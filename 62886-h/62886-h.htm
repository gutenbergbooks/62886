<p>When I first talked about the possibilities and advantages of communications
satellites to the Princeton Section of the Institute of Radio Engineers
on the evening of October 14, 1954, I was diligent in my analysis and
enthusiastic in my presentation but, I must confess, a little skeptical as to
whether or not anything would come of the idea.</p>
<p>Still, others and I at Bell Laboratories remained interested, and, after the
launching of Sputnik I on November 3, 1957, and of Explorer I on January
31, 1958, we worked actively toward satellite communications experiments.
This led to our work with Echo I (launched August 12, 1960) and finally
to the launching on July 10, 1962, of Telstar I&mdash;that satellite which became,
in the words of Queen Elizabeth, &ldquo;the invisible focus of a million
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This work on communications satellites has been a grand exploration
and opening up of a hitherto dark continent of science and technology. My
courageous friends at Bell Laboratories encountered therein surprising
difficulties and perplexing problems which I had never dreamed of, and
these intrepid and indefatigable adventurers grappled with them and mastered
them all.</p>
<p>Now you, who have in your own homes seen pictures transmitted across
the ocean by satellite, can learn first hand from the men who worked on
hard and varied technical problems just what these problems were and
how they were solved. And, by reading you can find out what sort of
knowledge, training, and habits you yourself will need if you wish some
day to adventure into those undiscovered or unexplored fields of technology

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Despite the title, this is not a physics textbook, and it will tell you only
part of the fascinating story of satellite communications. However, we have
tried to tell this story in a rather special way. Part I explains why we are
so interested in communicating by means of man-made satellites, describes
the important events in the progress of satellite communications (with
special emphasis on Project Telstar), and points out some of the very
knotty problems that had to be solved. Then, in Part II, we pick out six
typical satellite communications problems and go into them more deeply.</p>
<p>These case histories are examples of the things scientists and engineers
are constantly faced with. To narrate them we have called on six experts&mdash;Bell
Telephone Laboratories engineers and scientists who actually have
been working on the problems. The second half of our book is taken up by
their accounts of their own personal experiences. We hope that reading
them will give you an insight into what it is really like to be a scientist
or engineer working in a laboratory on an important new venture into the
future. We hope you will see that what they do is not all excitement and
glamour. It involves hard work, ingenious thinking, and plugging away
at tough problems. But this is what scientists and engineers enjoy&mdash;along
with the excitement and glamour, of course.</p>
<p>Only a part of what our authors talk about can strictly be called
&ldquo;physics&rdquo;&mdash;it is also engineering, chemistry, mathematics, and even psychology.
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
But almost all their work <i>is</i> based&mdash;when you get down to fundamentals&mdash;on
basic principles of classical physics taught in high school.</p>
<p>Now, a word of caution. In Part I, in talking about satellite communications
in general, we have kept things at a level that should be understandable
to almost everyone&mdash;even those who have never taken a high
school science course. But we warn you this isn&rsquo;t true of Part II. Our authors
have tried to tell their stories as carefully and as logically as possible, but
some readers may have trouble in following all they say. This we expect.
We haven&rsquo;t tried to sugar-coat or gloss over any essential details of the
problems or their solutions. We don&rsquo;t want you to think that solving them
was any easier than it actually was. And, since this is not intended as a
textbook, we may sometimes omit elementary material and go right to the
heart of the matter.</p>
<p>When this book was written satellite communications was still a technological
infant. It is growing and changing so swiftly that much of what
we say may soon be out of date. That can&rsquo;t be helped, of course, and
we ask you&mdash;who may be reading it long afterward&mdash;to be tolerant. Our
problems may well be forgotten when new, more sophisticated ones appear.
But we are dealing here in methods, not in history; the ways in
which these problems were attacked are just as lasting and important as
the problems themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Our intensive research and development in the field of communications
satellites have brought us to the point where we are now certain of the
technical feasibility of transmitting messages to any part of the world
by directing them to satellites.... The actual operation of such a system
would provide a dramatic demonstration of our leadership in this area of
space activity.... The direct benefits&mdash;economic, educational, and political&mdash;of
this improved world-wide communication will be invaluable</i>.&rdquo;
<span class="lr"><span class="smaller">&mdash;JOHN F. KENNEDY</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Why Do We Bother With Satellite Communications?</h4>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question to begin with. Why should we get involved in a
vast, complicated program such as communication by means of man-made
satellites? Is the end result really worth all the trouble that is
involved? As you go further, you will see that nothing to do with satellite
communications is as simple as it first seems. Even some of the easier
questions have been answered only after long hours of perceptive thinking,
ingenious experimenting, and shrewd deduction. They have required
a lot of hard work, led to many frustrating difficulties, and cost quite a
bit of money. But the answer still is yes. Despite all the difficulties, it is
clear that the creation of a successful satellite communicating system is
worth it.</p>
<p>There is a double reason for this. On the one hand, it is a technological
target that is now clearly within our range. We must either reach it or let
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
progress pass us by. Satellite communications is one field in which, as far
as we know, American engineering and science have been well in the
lead&mdash;so we have an even greater incentive to press on in this direction
as hard and as fast as we can.</p>
<p>But perhaps more important than the prestige it would give our country
is a second reason for our great interest in satellite communications:
We need it. The world today is going through one of its great periods
of change. This has caused many complications, and one of the most
important is the need for much better communications between nations
and peoples. By &ldquo;communications&rdquo; we mean all the various ways of
sending information from one place to another: mail, telephone calls,
business data, radio, television. The demand for these services&mdash;especially
when we look ahead to the 1970&rsquo;s and 1980&rsquo;s&mdash;will be tremendous.
Our international communications channels will be completely swamped
unless some major improvements are made.</p>
<p>Fortunately, modern technology&mdash;given a boost by the world&rsquo;s interest
in rockets, missiles, and the exploration of space&mdash;has shown us one
answer to this problem: the communications satellite. The conventional
pathways for long-distance communication have led along the earth&rsquo;s
surface, under the oceans, and through the lower atmosphere. No one of
these routes has yet provided all the capacity, speed, or quality we need.
Present underseas cables have a limited capacity; surface travel by ship
is too slow for anything but routine mail; short-wave radio is subject to
distortion and noise, and the available frequencies are rapidly being used
up. Although jet planes can span the oceans in a few hours with mail
and such things as taped television shows, the big need will be to send
information instantaneously. And the communications satellite offers us
a very promising way to do this.</p>
<h4>What a Communications Satellite Can Do</h4>
<p>One of the attractive things about using a satellite is that it doesn&rsquo;t require
a revolutionary breakthrough in technical knowledge. It can employ
a satisfactory means of communicating that is already available: the
microwave radio relay. Today, this kind of transmission is used on a routine
basis to send thousands of telephone calls and television programs
across long distances. It gives high-quality performance and has a large
message capacity. But there has always been one difficulty keeping us
from using it for overseas communications: Extremely high frequency
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
waves can travel almost unlimited distances, but they can go only in
straight lines. This means that the curvature of the earth limits a microwave&rsquo;s
line-of-sight path to about 30 miles; so we must build a series of
transmission relay towers spaced every 30 miles or so. Obviously, this
isn&rsquo;t possible when you send messages across an ocean. But, if we could
find a way to send a signal high up into the sky and then bounce it from
there back again to a far-off spot, we could send microwave messages
great distances.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Microwaves sent via an orbiting satellite can travel vast distances</i></p>
</div>
<p>As long ago as 1945, Arthur C. Clarke, an English writer and scientist,
proposed that a man-made satellite orbiting in space might be used to
relay signals in this way. In 1945, of course, the very idea of getting a
satellite out into space seemed utterly fantastic, and satellite communications
could only be classified as science fiction. Ten years later, although
Sputnik I had not yet been launched, artificial satellites were close to
reality. At that time, John R. Pierce of Bell Telephone Laboratories made
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
the first serious study of what would have to be done to build a working
satellite communication system&mdash;assuming it ever became possible to
put satellites into orbit. And Bell Laboratories has been interested in
satellite communications ever since.</p>
<h4>The Road to Successful Satellite Communications</h4>
<p>With the first launching of a satellite into orbit by the Soviet Union in
1957, the real development work on satellite communications began. By
1960 Project Echo had proved that signals could be reflected off a man-made
satellite and received several thousand miles away. And, in 1962,
Project Telstar demonstrated to the whole world that an active repeater
satellite could send telephone calls, data, and television across the ocean.</p>
<p>Bringing satellite communications almost to reality has required more
than putting a man-made satellite into orbit around the earth. Just as important
have been the invention and development of many remarkable new
devices: the transistor, the solar cell, the traveling wave tube, the horn-reflector
antenna, the waveguide, the solid-state maser, and the electronic
computer&mdash;to mention only some of the more important. Without them
it would still be impossible to find a tiny speeding object miles out in
space, send signals to it, amplify them billions of times, and then return
them to distant points on the earth.</p>

on a large number of communications experiments
and, most important, proves that it
is practical to use a man-made satellite to
reflect two-way telephone conversations across
the United States. Echo also dramatizes the
possibilities of satellites for communications.
Since it is a 100-foot inflated balloon made
from aluminum-coated Mylar, it is large enough
to be seen by the naked eye. People throughout
the world see Echo I sail on schedule across the sky in its 1000-mile-high
circular orbit. Three years later, although it is now wrinkled and
deflated, the balloon is still in orbit.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="362" height="366" />
</div>
<p>Project Echo provided valuable data for future work in satellite communications.
It demonstrated that a passive
satellite&mdash;that is, one that simply reflects the
microwave signals it receives from an earth
station back to another point&mdash;would work.
Two-way conversations of good quality were
sent between the Bell Laboratories Holmdel
station and Jet Propulsion Laboratories in Goldstone,
and successful transmission was made to
other points in the United States and Europe. A scaled-up horn-reflector
antenna proved itself. A method of receiving microwave signals that had
been little used until then, known as frequency modulation with feedback
(FMFB), performed very well. New types of low-noise amplifiers using
solid-state masers gave excellent results. And tracking of the satellite by
electronic computers, by radar, and by telescope proved to be extremely
reliable.</p>

the Telstar satellite, it is an active repeater device
that picks up telephone, television, and
other electronic signals and retransmits them
to a distant point. Relay also provides the first
satellite communications link between North
and South America. The satellite is a tapered
cylinder 33 inches long weighing 172 pounds.
A mast-like antenna at one end is used to receive
and transmit a single television broadcast or 12 simultaneous two-way
telephone conversations. Four whip antennas at the other end of the
cylinder handle control, tracking, and telemetry&mdash;turning experiments
on and off and sending information on the behavior of its components and
on the amount of radiation it encounters in space. Relay is powered by
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
nickel-cadmium storage batteries that are charged by more than 8,000 solar
cells mounted on its eight sides. It contains two identical receiving, amplifying,

of 10 watts.</p>
<p>Relay I is traveling in an orbit that ranges from 820 to 4,612 miles
high, and circles the earth about every 185 minutes. Soon after it is
launched, Relay&rsquo;s telemetry reports trouble in the voltage regulator of one
of the transponders, which causes excessive power drain. On January 3,

28 inches in diameter and 15&frac12; inches long, and
weighs 86 pounds. Like Telstar and Relay, it is powered by a combination
of solar cells and nickel-cadmium batteries, but it is designed to handle

<h4>What About the Future?</h4>
<p>As this is written (June 1963), second Relay and Syncom launchings are
in the offing. And there are plans for more experimentation with passive
satellites, including a new, more nearly rigid Echo balloon.</p>
<p>Further in the future, studies are going on of a proposed Intermediate
Altitude Communications Satellite for military use in the 6,000- to 10,000-mile-high
range (beyond that of Telstar and Relay) and Advanced Syncom,
a synchronous satellite of increased capacity. Work is also continuing
to acquire new technical knowledge that will be needed in the future&mdash;such
as various methods of keeping satellites stabilized in space and new
ways of supplying power, including improved solar cells and the use of
radioisotopes.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal, of course, is a working commercial communications
satellite system. Exactly when this will be a reality&mdash;and what form
it will take&mdash;are questions whose answers still lie ahead of us.</p>

<h2><span class="small">Project Telstar</span></h2>
<p>In this section we will go into some detail about Project Telstar. We do
this because much of what we learned from this project applies to the
general field of satellite communications. The problems that were faced
and solved are typical of the challenges that working engineers and scientists
must meet today. And there is, of course, another reason to put this
much emphasis on Telstar: The six case histories in Part II of our book
were written by men who were involved with that project. Before reading
their accounts it will be helpful for you to have some background information
about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h3>What Project Telstar Was Designed To Do</h3>
<p>Even its most enthusiastic planners at Bell Telephone Laboratories never
expected the sensation that Telstar caused. Although it was a deadly
serious venture&mdash;one of the steps along the way toward putting together
a workable satellite communications system&mdash;its success made it the inspiration,
among other things, of cartoons, jokes, and a couple of popular
songs. &ldquo;Telstar&rdquo; soon became a name recognized around the entire globe.
Stories about Project Telstar appeared in newspapers in almost every
language, in children&rsquo;s books, in women&rsquo;s fashion magazines.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>What caused all this stir in the summer and fall of 1962? The answer&mdash;now
that we look back on it&mdash;seems rather clear: For the first time,
the whole world discovered that satellite communications was really possible&mdash;that
peoples separated by oceans could now be united by live
television. Space had become an adventure, not just for lonely astronauts,
but for everyone right in his living room.</p>
<p>Project Telstar, of course, had more serious objectives:</p>
<ul><li>to prove that a broadband communications satellite could transmit telephone messages, data, and television;</li>
<li>to test, under the stresses of an actual launch and the hazards of space, some of the electronic equipment that had been developed for satellite communications;</li>
<li>to measure the radiation that a satellite would meet in space;</li>
<li>to find out the best ways to track a moving satellite accurately;</li>
<li>to provide a real-life test for the special satellite communications antennas and other ground station equipment.</li></ul>
<p>To do its principal job&mdash;communications&mdash;the Telstar I satellite had
to receive a signal from a ground station, amplify it, and then retransmit
it on a different frequency back to other points on the earth. This signal
had to be strong enough and good enough to be received and understood
on the ground.</p>
<p>To do its secondary job&mdash;measure radiation and other conditions in
space&mdash;the satellite had to be equipped with special testing devices and
had to have a means of reporting facts about the environment it encountered
in space and the effects of radiation on solar cells and transistors.</p>
<p>To let us know how well its equipment was working, the satellite had
to record and transmit a large number of measurements&mdash;including such
things as the temperature and pressure inside the satellite, its orientation
with respect to the sun, the current and voltage in various parts
of its electronic circuitry. Sending these measurements back to a ground
station is called <i>telemetry</i>.</p>
<p>To help with tracking, the satellite had to have a continuous radio
beacon signal that could be easily picked up on earth.</p>
<p>Finally, the satellite had to be able to control its equipment by means
of signals from the ground. To keep the solar power plant from being
overloaded, there had to be some way of &ldquo;commanding&rdquo; the satellite to
turn itself on or off. As you will read later, this was the one part of the
satellite that caused us the most headaches once Telstar I got into orbit.</p>

<h3>The Telstar I Satellite&mdash;Outside</h3>
<p>Telstar&rsquo;s outer appearance is very familiar by now: a 34&frac12;-inch sphere
with 72 flat facets, a double row of rectangular openings circling its
center, and a short, oddly twisted antenna on one end. Of the 72 facets,
60 are used for the solar cells that are the satellite&rsquo;s main power source.
When Telstar is in sunlight, these cells convert solar energy into electrical
power; at full capacity the 3600 solar cells will supply about 15 watts.
As time goes by, this power slowly diminishes as the cells are gradually
damaged by such hazards of space as radiation particles and micrometeorites.
To reduce this damage, the satellite&rsquo;s cells are covered with a
thin layer of man-made sapphire.</p>
<p>Two bands of rectangular openings go around the center of the satellite.
The smaller cavities, of which there are 72, are receiving antennas;
the 48 larger ones are transmitting antennas. This arrangement allows the
antennas to transmit and receive equally well in all directions&mdash;except
directly along the satellite&rsquo;s poles.</p>
<p>At one end of the satellite is an entirely separate receiving and transmitting
antenna that takes care of all the signals needed for Telstar&rsquo;s
command, tracking and telemetry. The antenna is composed of four
metal loops joined in the shape of a helix. It receives the important command
signals from the ground that give orders to the satellite&rsquo;s equipment.
It sends reports back to the ground from the special radiation
measuring devices and other sensors aboard the satellite, and it also
transmits the continuous 136-megacycle radio beacon that can be picked
up by ground equipment searching for Telstar.</p>
<p>Six of the satellite&rsquo;s flat facets are used for special measuring devices.
Two different radiation studies are made: finding out how much damage
will be done to solar cells and transistors, and determining how many
actual energetic particles&mdash;protons and electrons&mdash;are present in the
part of space that Telstar passes through. These different jobs are done
by special devices on various facets. One, for example, consists of seven
identical silicon transistors, six having different thicknesses of shielding
and one being left unshielded&mdash;the amount of damage done to each is
recorded and reported back to earth. Devices on another facet measure
the radiation damage to solar cells protected by various thicknesses of
sapphire. For the second radiation experiment&mdash;particle counting&mdash;four
different types of silicon diodes are used as particle detectors. These
measure the energy deposited both by protons of three energy levels
and by electrons as the satellite passes through belts of natural and man-produced
radiation in space.</p>

</div>
<p>There are two other special devices: Six single solar cells are spaced
at regular intervals around the satellite; these &ldquo;solar aspect&rdquo; indicators
report the quantity of sunlight hitting them&mdash;and thus tell the direction
in which the satellite is pointing. Three highly polished metal mirrors
are also placed on Telstar; flashes of sunlight reflected from them can
be seen in a telescope. To give a precise indication of the satellite&rsquo;s position,
the data obtained from both the solar aspect cells and from the
flashes off the mirrors are combined.</p>
<h3>The Telstar I Satellite&mdash;Inside</h3>
<p>Within the white aluminum-oxide outer shell of the satellite is crammed
a complicated array of electronic equipment. Surprisingly, most of this
gear has to do not with Telstar&rsquo;s prime function&mdash;communications&mdash;but
with its command and telemetry systems. The reason is that the
satellite is an experimental device, not just a spectacular way to relay
television programs. Altogether, the satellite&rsquo;s various electronic circuits
contain more than a thousand transistors and almost 1500 semiconductor
diodes, plus a single electron tube&mdash;a traveling-wave tube used in the
communications amplifier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The satellite itself has a magnesium frame that is covered with aluminum
panels. All its electronic components are inside a aluminum canister,
20 inches in diameter, attached to the interior frame by special nylon
lacings that reduced vibration inside the canister during launch. When
all the components and subassemblies had been carefully put in place
and thoroughly tested, the canister was filled with a liquid foam called
polyurethane. This material hardens into a very light and rigid solid,
completely enveloping the equipment and protecting it from damage
and vibration. After the canister was solidly foamed, metal domes were
welded onto the ends, and it was enclosed in a many-layered blanket of
aluminum-coated Mylar (the same material used in the Echo balloon).
To keep its temperature properly controlled, shutters on the canister&rsquo;s
two ends are operated by bellows.</p>
<p>The satellite power system includes more than just solar cells. When
operating at full capacity, the satellite&rsquo;s equipment needs more energy
than the 3600 solar cells can provide at one time. So Telstar also uses a
storage battery made up of 19 rechargeable nickel-cadmium cells designed
for this special purpose. These ensure that the satellite has a continuous
and sufficient supply of power, even when all equipment is in operation
or when the satellite is passing through the earth&rsquo;s shadow.</p>

</div>
<h3>Ground Stations for Satellite Communications</h3>
<p>Project Telstar is actually an extension into space of microwave communications
methods that have been thoroughly proved on the ground.
For Project Echo and other early experiments in satellite communications,
Bell Laboratories built a large antenna of the type known as a <i>horn-reflector</i>
in Holmdel, New Jersey. For Project Telstar, a similar but much
larger antenna was designed. It was located in a relatively isolated spot
at Andover, in the western part of Maine, where it would be close to
Europe. The site is nicely protected by a surrounding ring of low hills&mdash;high
enough to keep out interfering radio signals, but low enough not to
block the satellite when it is near the horizon.</p>
<p>The giant Andover horn is a steel and aluminum structure 177 feet
long and 94 feet high that weighs 380 tons. At one end is a giant opening
of 3600 square feet; from there the horn tapers down to a cab in which
the very sensitive receiver and powerful transmitting equipment is located.
The entire antenna&mdash;horn, cab, and supporting framework&mdash;moves
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
smoothly on tracks that allow it to rotate in a 360-degree circle around its
vertical axis (changing <i>azimuth</i>). It also can swing about its horizontal
axis from the horizon up to the zenith (changing <i>elevation</i>). Despite its
size, the antenna can revolve steadily and precisely in a complete circle
in just four minutes.</p>
<p>Signals are beamed to the satellite on a frequency of 6390 megacycles,
using modified Bell System microwave equipment and a special traveling-wave
tube with an output of 2 kilowatts. Signals come back on a 4170-megacycle
frequency at a much lower power level&mdash;as small as a <i>trillionth</i>
of a watt. They are amplified by a ruby crystal maser that operates at the
temperature of liquid helium&mdash;just a few degrees above absolute zero. The
whole antenna structure and its associated equipment are enclosed in a
huge &ldquo;radome&rdquo;&mdash;a bubble made from Dacron and synthetic rubber only a
sixteenth of an inch thick but measuring 210 feet in diameter and 160
feet high. It is one of the largest air-supported structures ever erected.</p>
<p>The Andover ground station includes a lot more equipment&mdash;most
of it having to do with tracking the satellite, computing its orbits, sending
and receiving command and telemetry signals, and interconnecting
the satellite with regular telephone and television land links. Most of this is
located in a control building about a quarter mile from the giant radome.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/p11a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="391" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The French radome looms over the Brittany countryside</i></p>
</div>
<p>A ground station very similar to the Andover installation has been
built by the French National Center of Telecommunications Studies at
Pleumeur-Bodou in Brittany. The British General Post Office has established
a station at Goonhilly Downs in Cornwall, England, which uses a
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
large, deep parabolic dish rather than a horn-reflector antenna. Both
British and French stations participated in the first Telstar experiments.
Satellite communications ground stations also have been set up in Fucino,
Italy, and near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and others are under construction in
West Germany and Japan.</p>
<h3>The Satellite Goes Into Orbit</h3>
<p>At 4:35 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) on July 10, 1962, a Thor-Delta
rocket launched Telstar I into its orbit, almost exactly according to plan,
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&rsquo;s Cape Canaveral
base. On Telstar&rsquo;s sixth orbit around the earth&mdash;at 7:26 p.m.&mdash;the
first transmission to and from the satellite took place. During this pass telephone
calls, television, and photos were transmitted between Andover and
Holmdel. Some of these signals were also picked up in Europe. On the next
day, a taped television program was sent from France to the United States,
and a live program came from England via Telstar. During the next four
months, more than 400 transmissions were handled by Telstar&mdash;including
50 television demonstrations (both black-and-white and color), the sending
of telephone calls and data in both directions, and the relaying of
facsimile and telephotos.</p>
<p>In addition, the satellite performed more than 300 valuable technical
tests. Almost all of them showed remarkably successful results. Radio
transmission was as good as was expected. Telstar&rsquo;s communications
equipment worked exactly as it should, with no damage from the shock
and vibration of the launch. Temperatures inside the satellite were kept
under good control. The satellite was successfully stabilized&mdash;prevented
from tumbling over and over&mdash;by being spun around its polar axis, with
the spin rate gradually decreasing, as predicted, from its rate of 177.7
revolutions per minute just after launch. The solar cells worked almost
exactly as expected. Much extremely valuable data about radiation in
space was reported. The ground stations accurately traced the fast-moving
satellite in almost routine fashion.</p>
<p>But it would be asking too much to have everything perfect. Telstar I
unexpectedly met radiation in space estimated to be 100 times more potent
than had been predicted. As a result, difficulties arose during November
1962 in some of the transistors in its command circuit&mdash;and on pages
<a href="#Page_78">78</a> to <a href="#Page_85">85</a> we tell you what these problems were, how they were discovered,
and what steps were taken to overcome them. Some time later the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
satellite again failed to respond to commands from the ground, and on
February 21, 1963, it went silent.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>New gold-domed device on the Telstar II satellite can measure electrons
in an energy range from 750 thousand to 2 million electron volts.</i></p>
</div>
<h3>The Second Telstar Satellite</h3>
<p>On May 7, 1963, the Telstar II satellite was launched into an elliptical
orbit almost twice as large as that of Telstar I, ranging from an
apogee of 6697 miles to a perigee of 604 miles. The new satellite circles
the earth once every 225 minutes. The higher altitude provides Telstar
II with longer periods when it is visible at both Andover and ground
stations in Europe, and keeps it out of the high-radiation regions of
space for a greater part of the time. The satellite itself is much the same
as Telstar I, except for a few minor changes that make its weight 175
rather than 170 pounds. Its radiation measuring devices have a greater
range of sensitivity, and there are six new measurements to be reported
back to earth. Telemetry can now be sent on both the microwave beacon
and, as before, on the 136-megacycle beacon. To help prevent the kind of
damage that occurred in the transistors of Telstar I&rsquo;s command decoders,
Telstar II uses a different type of transistor, in which the gases have been
removed from the cap enclosures that surround the transistor elements.
A simplified method of operation for the giant Andover horn antenna is
now in operation, with the autotrack alone being used for precise tracking
and pointing. Telstar II&rsquo;s first successful television transmission took
place on May 7, and a new series of technical tests, radiation measurements,
and experiments in transoceanic communications has begun.</p>

<h3>How the Telstar Satellite Works</h3>
<p>A lot of facts and figures sometimes lead only to confusion, but these pages may
help make things clearer. Here you can see&mdash;step by step&mdash;exactly what happens
during a typical pass of the Telstar satellite over the Andover ground station:</p>
<div class="img">

<p><b>1</b> <i>The satellite comes over the horizon.</i></p>
<p><b>2</b> <i>The command tracker, knowing from computer data the satellite&rsquo;s approximate

antenna (four long spirals) tracks the satellite to an accuracy of one degree.</i></p>
<p><b>3</b> <i>When the satellite is located, the command transmitter turns on the satellite&rsquo;s

<h2><span class="small">Some Big Problems in Satellite Communications</span></h2>
<p>We hope the last few pages haven&rsquo;t given you a wrong impression of
satellite communications. It is easy to assume, when we list the orderly,
step-by-step progress from purely theoretical ideas to a working satellite
such as Telstar, that everything has gone like clockwork. That isn&rsquo;t the
case at all&mdash;and in the rest of this book we are going to show you why
it isn&rsquo;t. Many problems had to be solved; many scientific and technological
advances had to be made.</p>
<p>We touched on a number of the problems of satellite communications
in our detailed account of Project Telstar. Most of them are not confined
to that project&mdash;they are the sorts of questions that any complex
advance in satellite communications will run into. We will list some of
the more important ones here. Then, in <a href="#c3">Part II</a>, we will talk about some
general methods of solving scientific and technological problems. All this
is a rather roundabout&mdash;but necessary&mdash;way of leading up to our main
interest: the accounts by six Bell Laboratories engineers and scientists of
their work to solve some typical problems in satellite communications.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The many complications of satellite communications can be divided
into several groups. First of all, there are the problems involved in <i>fitting
satellite communications into an already established world communications
system</i>. There are, next, many problems, both small and large, in
<i>designing the right kind of satellite</i>. There are the problems of <i>launching
a satellite and getting it into the proper orbit</i>. There are the problems in
<i>making sure it stays in the right orbit once it gets there</i>. And, finally there
are the problems in <i>seeing that it continues to do its job reliably</i>.</p>
<p>In these five categories there are a lot of specific questions that must be
answered to plan a working satellite communications system. A list of some
of them follows. We haven&rsquo;t attempted to cover everything, but these
should give you some idea of the tasks and questions involved in planning
an immense project like this.</p>

<h3>Six Typical Problems</h3>
<p>The questions we listed in <a href="#c2">Part I</a> cover a very broad area of science and
technology. Their answers involve, more than anything else, physics,
electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Some, however, also
require that the men who work on them know chemistry, metallurgy,
mathematics, and occasionally even biology, psychology, geography, and
economics.</p>
<p>We obviously can&rsquo;t show you how all the problems in <a href="#c2">Part I</a> can be
solved. Rather, we have picked six of them as examples. They are not
necessarily the most important ones, but they seem to us to be typical of
what engineers and scientists working in the satellite communications program
actually have to do. These are the six problems we will be talking
about at length:</p>
<ul><li><i>How do we calculate a satellite&rsquo;s orbit?</i></li>
<li><i>What color should a satellite be?</i></li>
<li><i>How can we make optical measurements on a satellite?</i></li>
<li><i>How do we keep solar cell power plants working in space?</i></li>
<li><i>Would time delay be a problem in using a synchronous satellite?</i></li>
<li><i>How can we repair an orbiting satellite?</i></li></ul>
<p>As you can see, we have picked problems that offer a good deal of variety.
Some of them have been satisfactorily solved; for others the solutions
are not yet complete. Some deal with basic scientific research; others are
much more concerned with the engineering applications of technical knowledge.
Some were solved by careful, logical thinking; others were solved
almost by accident. Some deal with a particular immediate task (in this
case, Project Telstar); others are more concerned with general planning
for satellite communications.</p>
<h3>At the Foundation: Basic Physical Principles</h3>
<p>Despite these many important differences, there is one common thread
running through the solving of all the problems we have chosen. The men
who have been working on them had to know some basic principles of
classical physics&mdash;principles that most of them first learned in their high
school physics classes. You can&rsquo;t, for example, calculate a satellite&rsquo;s orbit
without knowing Newton&rsquo;s Laws of Motion. You can&rsquo;t make optical measurements
on a satellite without knowing the law of reflection of light. You
can&rsquo;t decide what color a satellite should be without knowing the law of
heat exchange.</p>
<p>To emphasize the importance of a solid grounding in basic physical
principles, we have tried to have our problems touch on most of the general
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
areas of physics: mechanics, heat, sound, light, electricity and magnetism,
electronics, the properties of matter, atomic physics, physics of the
solid state. But most of them, of course, are not limited to just one of these&mdash;they
cross the lines of a number of areas. For instance, the problem
of keeping solar cell power plants working in space involves laws of heat,
mechanics, and atomic physics, as well as physics of the solid state. And,
in studying the perception of time delay, we even branch out into experimental
psychology.</p>
<h3>Problem-Solving Techniques</h3>
<p>When you start to solve a problem in science or engineering you can go
about it in several ways. In some cases you have no choice: There may be
only one practical method of doing the job. Other times, there may be
several ways to attack the problem. You may try one, find it to be unfruitful,
and then work on another approach. You will see both these methods
of attack in the case histories we present in the next chapter.</p>
<p>Here are some of the techniques of scientific problem solving that we
will be discussing:</p>
<ul><li><i>Applying basic principles directly.</i> In answering the questions &ldquo;How do
we calculate a satellite&rsquo;s orbit?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What color should a satellite be?&rdquo; the
successful procedure was to begin with basic known concepts and use
them in a new field.</li>
<li><i>Adapting known devices.</i> To answer the question &ldquo;How can we make
optical measurements on a satellite?&rdquo; the story was somewhat different:
Devices that already had been developed&mdash;mirrors, telescopes, and cathode
ray tubes&mdash;were utilized in a new and different way.</li>
<li><i>Developing entirely new equipment.</i> Another question&mdash;&ldquo;How do we
keep solar cell power plants working in space?&rdquo;&mdash;deals with an entirely
new area of investigation; it could only be answered by perfecting some
entirely new techniques.</li>
<li><i>Experimentation.</i> Sometimes there is no definite answer to a problem. In
the case of &ldquo;Would time delay be a problem in using a synchronous satellite?&rdquo;
investigation is still going on. Our report tells of one set of experiments
that helped add to our information about this problem&mdash;the final
answer, if there is one, must come later. But, as with many problems, experimentation
continues.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<i>Detective work.</i>&rdquo; Our sixth problem is really a unique one&mdash;and, for
want of a better way to describe it, we use this title. It tells how the problem
of &ldquo;How can we repair an orbiting satellite?&rdquo;&mdash;something never even
attempted before&mdash;was ingeniously solved by means of scientific deduction
hundreds of miles away from the problem itself.</li>

<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p><i>Before you can do anything with a communications satellite
you have to know where it is at every instant of its motion around the
earth. In other words, you need to know its orbit quite accurately. When
you know this, you can predict when a particular station on the ground will
be able to see the satellite and communicate with it. You also can tell when
two or more stations can see the satellite simultaneously and communicate
with each other. And you can estimate how many satellites will be needed
to provide a group of ground stations with enough working time to maintain
a communications service. This last, after all, is the ultimate goal of
all our efforts in the communications satellite field.</i></p>
<p><i>In determining a satellite&rsquo;s orbit, we find that we must do three things:</i></p>
<ul><li><i>We must obtain information on the position&mdash;and perhaps also the velocity&mdash;of the satellite whenever possible by observing it with scientific instruments.</i></li>
<li><i>We must use this information to determine the satellite&rsquo;s orbit at the time of the observations.</i></li>
<li><i>We must be able to tell how this orbit changes between the times when we observe it, because a satellite&rsquo;s orbit does not remain constant with the passage of time.</i></li></ul>
<p><i>In the case of the Echo I satellite (see <a href="#Page_16">page 16</a>), we engaged in the first
and third of these activities. We had many chances to follow the satellite
with our radars, and we could speculate how its orbit was changing through
the months. In the case of the Telstar I satellite, we engaged in all three
kinds of activity. We shall take a look at these problems in the sequence in
which we came across them, for both the Echo and Telstar satellites.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h3>How We Track Satellites</h3>
<p>We collect on the ground most of the information
to calculate a satellite&rsquo;s orbit,
using optical instruments or radar equipment.
Following a satellite through the
sky is called <i>tracking</i>; in the early days
after the first Sputniks, some of this tracking
was done with the naked eye or with
very simple telescopes by the Moonwatch
teams. Many of you may have observed
Echo I on a clear night without any kind
of instrument.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="702" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Figure 1</i></p>

<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>satellite</dt>
<dt>horizon</dt>
<dt>elevation</dt>
<dt>azimuth</dt>
<dt>North</dt>
<dt>East</dt></dl>
<p>If we use a telescope, we note the time
of the observation and we usually take a
photograph of the satellite. We locate the
satellite in terms of the two angles shown
in <i><a href="#fig27">Figure 1</a></i>. One of these is the <i>elevation</i>
angle&mdash;the number of degrees a telescope
must be tilted above the horizon to see
the satellite. The second is the <i>azimuth</i>
angle&mdash;the number of degrees between
the plane in which we measure the elevation
angle and the north direction. Of
course, we can also point a radar antenna
at the satellite in the same manner. The
radar can receive a signal transmitted by
the satellite, or else it can send a signal to
the satellite and watch for the reflected
waves that eventually return. In the latter
case, the satellite must have sufficient surface
area to produce an adequate reflected
signal. These two kinds of precision tracking
were both possible with Echo I. Radar
can also do something that optical equipment
usually can&rsquo;t do: measure the distance
out to the satellite.</p>
<h3>The Basic Physics of Satellite Motion</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/p15a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="376" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Figure 2</i></p>
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>earth</dt>
<dt>north pole</dt>
<dt>satellite</dt>
<dt>&theta; = <i>n</i> &middot; <i>t</i></dt></dl>
<p>The Echo I satellite was launched into a
circular orbit inclined at an angle to the
plane of the earth&rsquo;s equator. In <i><a href="#fig28">Figure 2</a></i>
this equatorial plane intersects the plane
of the satellite orbit along the line OPM.
The point O represents the center of the
earth, the point M is on the satellite orbit,
and the Point P is on the equator. At any
instant, the satellite may be located in its
orbit by the angle &theta;, which is measured
between the line OM and the line OQ,
where the point Q is the satellite&rsquo;s location.
If the satellite moves in a circular
orbit, as in this case, the angle &theta; is proportional
to time. That is, we can write
&theta; = <i>nt</i>. We call <i>n</i> the <i>angular speed</i> of
the satellite; one way of measuring this is
in degrees per second.</p>
<p>Thus, the satellite is whirling at a constant
speed about the earth like a stone
tied to a string. Let us examine the physics
of this situation a little more closely
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
with the help of <i><a href="#fig29">Figure 3</a></i>. If the satellite
is moving with the velocity <i>v</i>, then we
know that the centrifugal force acting on
it is</p>
<div class="pc"><table class="eq inline"><tr><td><i>mv</i>&sup2;</td></tr><tr><td class="ul"><i>r</i></td></tr></table>,</div>
<p>where <i>m</i> is the mass of the satellite and
<i>r</i> is its distance from the center of the
earth. Obviously, no string ties the satellite
to the earth, but the force of gravitational
attraction between the earth and the
satellite has the same effect. Newton&rsquo;s law
of mutual attraction tells us that this force
is proportional to the product of the two
masses divided by the square of the distance
between their centers, or</p>
<div class="pc"><table class="eq inline"><tr><td><i>km</i></td></tr><tr><td class="ul"><i>r</i>&sup2;</td></tr></table>,</div>
<p>where <i>k</i> is a constant that essentially represents
the mass of the earth.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> Newton&rsquo;s
law also tells us that this force will be
pointing toward the center of the earth
if the earth is spherical. When the satellite
is in circular motion, the centrifugal force
and the gravitational force must balance
each other. Hence we have</p>
<div class="pc"><table class="eq inline"><tr><td><i>km</i></td></tr><tr><td class="ul"><i>r</i>&sup2;</td></tr></table> = <table class="eq inline"><tr><td><i>mv</i>&sup2;</td></tr><tr><td class="ul"><i>r</i></td></tr></table></div>
<p>and from this we can solve to find that the
velocity of the satellite must be equal to</p>
<div class="pc"><i>v</i> = <span class="x2">&#8730;</span><table class="eq inline"><tr><td class="ul"><i>k</i></td></tr><tr><td class="ul"><i>r</i></td></tr></table>.</div>
<p>In the case of the Echo I satellite, which
was designed to have a radial distance of
<i>r</i> = 5000 miles, this velocity amounts to
about 4.4 miles per second. The time for
one revolution in orbit is obtained with
the formula</p>
<div class="pc"><i>T</i> = <table class="eq inline"><tr><td>2<i>&pi;r</i></td></tr><tr><td class="ul"><i>v</i></td></tr></table>.</div>
<p>For the Echo satellite this time, <i>T</i>, turns
out to be just about two hours.</p>

<h3>Calculating the Orbit of Echo I</h3>
<p>These basic physical principles of satellite
motion can give us many useful answers.
They tell us how fast we must
move a precision tracker to follow the
satellite through the sky, how much time
a satellite will spend above the horizon,
and how long will be the time from one
chance of seeing it to the next. However,
in the Echo project we were not merely
concerned with planning our experiments
from hour to hour; we also needed to
know how the satellite would move for
weeks and perhaps months in advance.
When you study the motion of a satellite
over such a length of time, you discover
that its circular orbit will not remain the
same as it was at launch. This fact had
been observed on other satellites and was
to be expected also with Echo.</p>
<p>In everything we have said so far it
was assumed that the earth was a perfect
sphere, which is the way a geographer&rsquo;s
globe presents it to us. In reality, the
earth is somewhat flattened, with its diameter
from the north pole to the south
pole being somewhat shorter than its diameter
at the equator. One way of looking
at this is to visualize the earth as a sphere
with some material added in the equatorial
zone, which we may call <i>equatorial
bulge</i>. This bulge causes Echo&rsquo;s orbit to
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
have a slow &ldquo;wobble&rdquo; about the earth&rsquo;s
polar axis, somewhat like that of a spinning
top.</p>
<p>Another force that makes the satellite&rsquo;s
orbit shift slightly is the faint pressure
caused by the light from the sun. Although
this pressure is much too small for us to
perceive without the help of very delicate
instruments, it is enough to affect a satellite,
which has nothing to support it in
space and is exposed to solar pressure for
a very long time. Since the Echo balloon
is a plastic sphere, 100 feet in diameter,
that weighs only a little more than 100
pounds, the light rays striking its surface
are enough to cause a second &ldquo;wobble&rdquo;
effect. This wobble centers about the line
from the earth to the sun. Light pressure
also forces the orbit to go slightly out of
round from a perfect circle, and other
gradual effects on the satellite&rsquo;s orbit are
caused by the gravitational attraction of
the moon and the sun.</p>
<p>All these disturbances are ever-present
and act simultaneously, and a satellite&rsquo;s
total response to them is very complicated.
Fortunately, however, most of the
changes take place at a very slow and
uniform rate, and we can predict them
fairly accurately.</p>
<h3>Calculating the Orbit of Telstar I</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="441" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Figure 4</i></p>
</div>
<p>In Project Telstar we had to calculate the
satellite&rsquo;s orbit from observations made
by our precision trackers. This introduced
a few problems in addition to the ones we
encountered with Project Echo. In the
first place, the orbit of the Telstar satellite
is a elongated ellipse, as indicated in
<i><a href="#fig30">Figure 4</a></i>, rather than being almost circular,
as in the case of Echo I. We mentioned
earlier that a precision tracker can
furnish data on a satellite&rsquo;s elevation
angle, <i>E</i>, and azimuth, <i>A</i> (see <i><a href="#fig27">Figure 1</a></i>).
It can also give us a reading for &rho;, the
distance from the tracker to the satellite
(<i><a href="#fig30">Figure 4</a></i>). If we know the position of the
tracker on the earth, we can reduce the
quantities <i>A</i>, <i>E</i>, and &rho; to the angle &theta; and
the distance <i>r</i> (measured from the center
of the earth to the satellite). These two
quantities locate the satellite in the plane
of its orbit, but in order to describe its
position completely we must also specify
this orbital plane. In <i><a href="#fig31">Figure 5</a></i> the orbital
plane is shown as a shaded surface, with
&theta; and <i>r</i> being the same as before. You will
recall that the line OM represents the
intersection between this plane and the
equatorial plane; we call the angle <i>i</i> between
the two planes the <i>inclination</i> of
the orbit. Finally, we have the angle &Omega;
between the line OM and some line OA
to the point A, which we can choose as
any convenient spot in the equatorial
plane. Now we have specified the orbital
plane completely. The point A can be
found from day to day by fixing its position
relative to a certain star in the sky.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/p16a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="241" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Figure 5</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Figures <a href="#fig30">4</a> and <a href="#fig31">5</a> tell us something about
the geometry of the satellite&rsquo;s <i>position</i> in
space, but for the complete story we must
also give the <i>time</i> at which it can be found
there. For this purpose, there are some
astronomical laws that relate position on
an elliptic orbit to time. Two of these are
illustrated in <i><a href="#fig32">Figure 6</a></i>; in looking at this
figure, you should imagine that you are
standing off to one side of the orbital
plane to get a good view of the entire
orbit. The longest dimension of the ellipse,
2<i>a</i>, is called the <i>major axis</i>; this dimension
is related to the satellite&rsquo;s <i>period</i>&mdash;the
time it takes to go once around the ellipse.
More than three hundred years ago the
astronomer Johannes Kepler observed that
the period <i>T</i>, of an ellipse is</p>
<div class="pc"><i>T</i> = 2&pi;<span class="x2">&#8730;</span><table class="eq inline"><tr><td class="ul"><i>a</i>&sup3;</td></tr><tr><td class="ul"><i>k</i></td></tr></table>,</div>
<p>where <i>k</i> again was (using Newton&rsquo;s work)
essentially the mass of the earth.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig32">
<img src="images/p16c.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="592" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Figure 6</i></p>
</div>
<p>Instead of a complete revolution, we
may only be concerned with part of one
orbit. Let&rsquo;s say that this part lies between
the two positions P&#8321; and P&#8322; that the satellite
occupies at the two times <i>t</i>&#8321; and <i>t</i>&#8322;
(see <i><a href="#fig32">Figure 6</a></i>). Then another of Kepler&rsquo;s
laws says that the ratio between the time
difference <i>t</i>&#8322; - <i>t</i>&#8321; and the period <i>T</i> equals
the ratio between the sector of the ellipse
OP&#8321;P&#8322; and the area of the entire ellipse.</p>
<p>Now let us see how we can use the
quantities <i>r</i>, &theta;, <i>i</i>, and &Omega; as well as Kepler&rsquo;s
two time laws to determine the motion of
the satellite in space. Suppose that we
have made observations of the Telstar at
two times <i>t</i>&#8321; and <i>t</i>&#8322; and that we have measured
its distance along lines &rho;&#8321; and &rho;&#8322; in
<i><a href="#fig33">Figure 7</a></i>. In other words, we know that at
these two times the satellite was at the
points P&#8321; and P&#8322;. Since three points determine
a plane, we know in this case that
P&#8321;, P&#8322;, and O define the satellite orbital
plane. Knowing this, we can now calculate
the angles &theta;&#8321; and &theta;&#8322;, the distances
<i>r</i>&#8321; and <i>r</i>&#8322;, and the angles <i>i</i> and &Omega;. (The
detailed formulas for this are derived from
analytic geometry.)</p>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/p16d.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="652" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Figure 7</i></p>
</div>
<p>However, we still do not know the
length and the width of the particular
ellipse the satellite is following and how
this orbit is oriented within the orbital
plane. Let us imagine again that we can
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
stand off to one side of the orbit and take
a good look at it; <i><a href="#fig34">Figure 8</a></i> shows us what
we would see. There are the two points
P&#8322; and P&#8321; at which we have observed the
satellite. We know the positions of these
points relative to each other and in relation
to the center of the earth, because
we have already calculated <i>r</i>&#8322;, <i>r</i>&#8321;, &theta;&#8322;, and
&theta;&#8321;, But any number of ellipses could be
made to pass through these two points.
Some might be very large, others might be
so narrow that they would intersect the
earth and thus be impossible. However,
only one of these ellipses will satisfy the
time difference that we observed between
P&#8321; and P&#8322;. In other words, the shape and
period of this particular ellipse must be
such that it will cause the satellite to pass
through P&#8321; and P&#8322; in exactly the time
interval <i>t</i>&#8322; - <i>t</i>&#8321;. If we work out our time
formulas, we will convince ourselves that
there is only one such ellipse. When we
have found it, we have determined the
orbit of the Telstar satellite from the two
observed positions and times.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="683" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Figure 8</i></p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig35">
<img src="images/p17a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="553" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Figure 9</i></p>
</div>
<p>In principle then, we could keep track
of the Telstar satellite by making a pair
of observations P&#8321; and P&#8322;, and then predicting
ahead a short segment of an orbit
that is the ellipse we have computed.
After a while we must verify this ellipse
with two more observations P&#8323; and P&#8324;,
predict ahead over another segment, and
verify again with P&#8325; and P&#8326; (see <i><a href="#fig35">Figure 9</a></i>),
The reason we have to keep taking new
measurements is that the elliptic orbit
does not remain the same. As we discussed
in connection with Echo I, the orbital
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
plane will &ldquo;wobble&rdquo; about the earth because
of the equatorial bulge. We also
know that the orbit&rsquo;s major axis will revolve
within the orbital plane. As we have
seen before, these effects are small and
can be represented by appropriate mathematical
formulas. If we calculate them, we
will see the connection between one pair
of observations and a later one, and eventually
we can increase the time interval
between successive pairs of observations.
There are also mathematical formulas that
we can use to predict the position of the
satellite for many revolutions in its elliptic
orbit.</p>
<p>In order to predict orbits successfully,
we must also realize that the measurements
we obtain from a precision tracker,
such as the angles <i>A</i> and <i>E</i> and the distance
&rho;, are always subject to small inaccuracies.
Thus it is not really possible to
take just two measurements like P&#8321; and
P&#8322; and determine a satisfactory orbit from
them. In reality, our tracker takes many
readings, and these are averaged to give
adequate information about the orbit.
Therefore, the picture we have in mind is
not quite like <i><a href="#fig33">Figure 7</a></i>, but rather like
<i><a href="#fig36">Figure 10</a></i>. Here the trackers have established
a series of points that are somewhat
scattered, and by taking averages we can
calculate an orbit that passes through
them in a smooth fashion.</p>
<p>The trackers we have mentioned so far
have given us azimuth and elevation
angles and also the distance to the satellite
at every instant. Sometimes we must
use simpler instruments that do not yield
all this information. They might, for instance,
only give us the two angles. The
mathematics of calculating an orbit from
such measurements is somewhat different,
but the process is fundamentally the same
as we have discussed here.</p>
<p>When you do these calculations for the
Telstar satellite from one day to the next&mdash;and
especially if you have more than
one satellite to keep track of&mdash;the amount
of work will become quite large. Nowadays
our calculations are done for us on
electronic computers, which both receive
information from the tracking instruments
automatically through Teletype or DataPhone
channels and send back information
concerning future positions of the
satellite to the ground stations. There are
still quite a few problems to be solved,
and we are presently working on ways of
making all this equipment perform the
orbit predictions for the Telstar satellites
automatically and efficiently.</p>

<br />What Color Should a Satellite Be?</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Peter Hrycak</span>
<br /><i>Mechanical Engineer&mdash;Member of Staff, Electron Device Laboratory</i></p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p><i>It is important for a satellite to stay at the proper temperature
while it is orbiting in space. The instruments aboard it must continue to
operate properly, and one way of insuring this is to keep them from being
exposed to extreme heat or cold. We can, of course, regulate a satellite&rsquo;s
temperature somewhat with various kinds of devices, and we can see that
one of its ends does not point towards the sun for too long. But in designing
the Telstar satellite we also wanted to control temperature in an easier
way: by covering the satellite&rsquo;s external surface with material with the best
properties&mdash;including the right color&mdash;for maintaining its over-all temperature
at the right level.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h3>The Radiation of Heat</h3>
<p>A satellite&rsquo;s temperature is determined by
the balance between the heat that enters
the satellite and the heat that leaves it.
This means that we must be concerned
with how heat is transferred. Heat can be
transferred in three ways: by <i>conduction</i>,
when two bodies are in direct contact
and their molecules collide; by <i>convection</i>,
which utilizes the movement of
warm currents in a fluid; and by <i>radiation</i>,
in which heat energy travels as electromagnetic
waves at the speed of light.
With a satellite, we are concerned only
with the last of these, since the only way
energy can be gained or lost in space is
by radiation.</p>
<p>In the transfer of heat by radiation, the
surface of the heated body&mdash;such as a
satellite&mdash;is very important. All energy
gained must be absorbed at the surface;
all energy leaving must be emitted at the
surface. So the physical properties of this
surface control how energy is absorbed
and how it is emitted. The origin of the
radiant energy is vitally important; most
surfaces, for instance, will behave differently
when exposed to solar radiation from
the sun&rsquo;s temperature of 10,000&deg; Fahrenheit
than when exposed to radiation from
nearby objects at room temperature.</p>
<h3>Absorptivity and Emissivity</h3>
<p>The physical property of a material that
controls the way it absorbs radiant energy
is called its <i>absorptivity</i>, and the property
that controls its emission of energy is its
<i>emissivity</i>. For absorptivity we use the
symbol &alpha;; for emissivity we use the symbol
&epsilon;.</p>
<p>When radiant energy reaches a surface,
only a certain part of it is absorbed; the
rest is either reflected, just as light rays
are reflected, or else passes right through
it. The absorptivity, &alpha;, of a substance tells
us what percentage of radiant energy it
will absorb. A perfect absorber, or <i>black
body</i>, would absorb all the radiant energy
that reached it. If such an ideal substance
existed (which it doesn&rsquo;t) we would say
it had an &alpha; of 1. The actual absorptivities
of real substances are indicated by numbers
between 0 and 1: The &alpha; of black velvet
cloth, for example, is about 0.97; that
of a polished silver mirror is about 0.08
for solar radiation (absorptivity for most
polished metals for room temperature
radiation is even lower).</p>
<p>We measure emissivity, &epsilon;, in very much
the same way. A hypothetical black body
would emit all the energy it possibly could
and have an &epsilon; of 1; the emissivities of real
substances are indicated by numbers between
0 and 1. For any given frequency
(or color) of light, a substance&rsquo;s absorptivity
and emissivity are equal; however,
the total spectrum of frequencies of the
energy absorbed is usually different from
that of the energy emitted.</p>
<p>The ratio between emissivity and absorptivity,
&alpha;/&epsilon;, is very important, as we
shall see later. If this ratio is greater than
1, it means that a substance absorbs heat
faster than it emits it, and thus tends to
become warmer. If the ratio is less than 1,
the reverse is true&mdash;the surface emits radiant
energy at a faster rate than it absorbs
it, and tends to become cooler.</p>
<h3>How We Measure the Radiation of Heat</h3>
<p>This is one of the fundamental relationships
of modern physics:</p>
<div class="pc"><i>Q</i><sub>body</sub> = &epsilon;<i>A</i>&sigma;<i>T</i>&#8308;.</div>
<p>It was discovered experimentally by Josef
Stefan in 1879, and verified theoretically
by Ludwig Boltzmann; it is known as the
<i>Stefan-Boltzmann Law</i>. This formula tells
us the amount of radiant energy, Q<sub>body</sub>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
that will be emitted by a body having the
surface area <i>A</i> when it is at the temperature
<i>T</i>. Temperature, here, is measured in
degrees Rankine (&deg;R), or Fahrenheit temperature
above absolute zero (to calculate
degrees Rankine, add 460 to the temperature
in degrees Fahrenheit). The expression
&epsilon;<i>A</i> is used to show that only a certain
fraction of the energy that would leave a
perfect black body of area <i>A</i> will actually
leave a real body of the same size; the size
of this fraction is determined by the
body&rsquo;s emissivity. The symbol &sigma; is a quantity
we call the <i>Stefan-Boltzmann constant</i>.</p>
<p>We can also calculate the heat from the
sun that will be absorbed by a body. If we
let <i>S</i> be the total amount of solar energy
that would be absorbed by a perfect black
body, &alpha;<i>S</i> will be the amount that is actually
absorbed by a body with an absorptivity
of &alpha; for solar radiation. If our body
is a spherical satellite, the sun&rsquo;s rays will
only strike it from a single direction. Thus
only an area equivalent to the sphere&rsquo;s
cross-section (largest inscribed circle) will
receive energy at any one time. Since, <i>as
shown in the <a href="#fig37">sketch</a></i>, this area (<i>a</i> = &pi;<i>r</i>&sup2;)
is one-fourth that of the sphere&rsquo;s total surface
area (<i>A</i> = 4&pi;<i>r</i>&sup2;), we know that the
radiant energy from the sun that is absorbed
will be</p>
<div class="pc"><i>Q</i><sub>sun</sub> = <table class="eq inline"><tr><td><i>A</i></td></tr><tr><td class="ul">4</td></tr></table>&alpha;<i>S</i>.</div>
<p>A man-made satellite&rsquo;s position relative
to the earth is very like that of the earth
in relation to the sun; the earth, after all,
is itself a satellite of the sun. And during
most of its useful life a satellite will be in
<i>thermal equilibrium</i>&mdash;it will be losing just
as much heat energy by its own radiation
into space as it will be gaining from other
sources, primarily the sun. Since the total
amount of energy it absorbs is equal to the
amount of energy it emits, <i>Q</i><sub>body</sub> is equal
to <i>Q</i><sub>sun</sub>. This means that we have the
equality</p>
<div class="pc">&epsilon;<i>A</i>&sigma;<i>T</i>&#8308; = <table class="eq inline"><tr><td><i>A</i></td></tr><tr><td class="ul">4</td></tr></table>&alpha;<i>S</i>.</div>
<p>Now, if we solve this for temperature, we
will get</p>
<div class="pc"><i>T</i> = <span class="x2">(</span><table class="eq inline"><tr><td>&alpha;</td></tr><tr><td class="ul">&epsilon;</td></tr></table> &times; <table class="eq inline"><tr><td><i>S</i></td></tr><tr><td class="ul">4&sigma;</td></tr></table><span class="x2">)</span><table class="eq inline"><tr><td><sup>&frac14;</sup></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table>.</div>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="379" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Although the total surface area, A, of a sphere is 4&pi;r&sup2;, light rays from the sun only strike half
the surface at any one time. This area, a, is effectively equal to the sphere&rsquo;s cross-section, &pi;r&sup2;.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This equation is well known in astronomy,
and has been used for more than 80 years
to calculate the temperatures of various
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
objects in the sky. Today, we still find it
useful for measuring the surface temperatures
of man-made satellites such as Telstar.
Since both <i>S</i> and &sigma; are known constants
(in this case, we use the quantities
<i>S</i> = 445 and &sigma; = 0.173 &times; 10&#8315;&#8312;), you can
see that temperature is dependent on the
&alpha;/&epsilon; ratio.</p>
<h3>Finding the Right Surface for Telstar</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig38">
<img src="images/p18a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="409" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Cutaway view of the inside of the Telstar I satellite, showing the electronics canister covered

<dt>frame</dt></dl>
<p>In designing the Telstar satellite, both
its internal and external temperatures had
to be controlled. The electronics canister
inside the satellite operates best if it stays
at approximately room temperature of 65
to 75&deg;F. This much heat is supplied in
the canister by dissipation of electrical
energy from the solar cells. The container
is well insulated to keep its temperature
relatively stable, and it has shutters that
open automatically if it begins to get overheated
(<i>see <a href="#fig38">above</a></i>). The operating
characteristics of the solar cells on Telstar&rsquo;s
surface also had to be considered;
they work better at rather cool temperatures.
So we decided to keep the satellite&rsquo;s
skin at an average temperature of about
0&deg;F, although temperatures actually will
range quite a bit above and below the
average as the satellite moves from sun
to shadow.</p>
<p>Now, using this average temperature of
0&deg;F (converted to 460&deg;R) as <i>T</i> in our
formula, we can solve for &alpha;/&epsilon;. We find
that this gives us a ratio of approximately
0.7 for the satellite&rsquo;s surface. However,
this presents a problem. Almost 40 per
cent of Telstar&rsquo;s surface is taken up by its
power plant of 3600 sapphire-covered
solar cells. These cells, unfortunately,
have a relatively high &alpha;/&epsilon; ratio&mdash;their
&alpha; is 0.8 and their &epsilon; is 0.54, for an &alpha;/&epsilon; of
1.5. This means that the portion of the
surface not used by either solar cells or
antenna openings must, in order to give
us an over-all average of about 0.7, have
a very low &alpha;/&epsilon; ratio&mdash;less than 0.3.</p>
<p>To get this sort of ratio, we had to select
carefully the material for the outer surface
of the Telstar satellite. There were many
kinds of surfaces that might have been
used; they could have been metal or non-metal,
rough or smooth, shiny or dull. And
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
they could have been any color from
black to white. However, to get a 0.3 ratio
we needed something with a relatively
high emissivity for the low-frequency
electromagnetic radiation that the satellite
emits and a rather low absorptivity
for the high-frequency radiation coming
from the sun. High emissivity meant that
we should use a nonmetal surface rather
than polished metal, since the emissivity
of nonmetals is quite high at the temperatures
in which we were interested, while
that of polished metals is relatively low.
And, to get low absorptivity, we decided
that the color of these surface areas should
be very close to a pure white.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig39">
<img src="images/p19.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="379" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Partially molten aluminum oxide particles being sprayed onto aluminum outer surface panels.</i></p>
</div>
<p>There were several substances that met
our requirements. After testing a number
of them, we decided to use aluminum
panels coated with a thin layer of aluminum
oxide (Al&#8322;O&#8323;). This coating is very
pure, hard, and stable, and we left it
rough to minimize changes due to meteoroid
abrasion. Its &alpha;/&epsilon; ratio is 0.24. The
aluminum oxide coating can be applied
by means of the plasma jet process&mdash;particles
of aluminum oxide are heated to a
partially molten state, mixed with gases,
and then sprayed onto the cleaned, pre-coated
aluminum panels (<i>see <a href="#fig39">illustration above</a></i>).</p>
<p>Using this carefully selected outer surface
has helped solve the temperature-control
problem. Since Telstar has been
in orbit its internal and skin temperatures
have kept well within the ranges we
wanted them to. Thus you can see how
some basic formulas from classical physics
helped us choose the right material for
the satellite&rsquo;s surface&mdash;and even what color
it should be. The blue-and-white checkered
appearance that Telstar I finally took
on was no accident&mdash;it was the result of
carefully combining various colors and
materials in just the right amounts to obtain
the temperature balance we needed.</p>

<br />How Can We Make Optical Measurements on a Satellite?</h2>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Jeofry S. Courtney-Pratt</span>
<br /><i>Physicist&mdash;Head, Mechanics Research Department</i></p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p><i>Since the first Telstar satellite went into orbit, we have tried to
trace its path through space precisely. But we also have had to keep a constant
check on the position, or attitude, that the satellite takes as it travels.
We are particularly interested in the direction of the spin axis about which
it revolves, and we also want to know its spin rate, which is the number
revolutions the satellite makes each minute. Although these might seem
relatively simple jobs, they actually turned out to be rather complicated.
And only at virtually the last minute, just before the satellite&rsquo;s design was
finally set, did we think of a new way of using reflected flashes of sunlight
to report on its spin axis and spin rate.</i></p>
<h3>Why We Want to Know About the Spin Axis</h3>
<p>When the satellite was injected into its
orbit, it was spin-stabilized to keep it from
tumbling over and over, much as a rifle
bullet is stabilized by being spun about its
longitudinal axis. The Telstar satellite is
roughly spherical, and it was designed to
spin with the helical antenna end as its
north pole and the antenna bands as its
equator. On July 10, 1962, the satellite
was given an initial spin of 177.7 revolutions
a minute. As we expected, this rate
is decreasing gradually; after two years it
will only be spinning one tenth as fast.</p>
<p>The most important reason for keeping
a close watch on the satellite&rsquo;s spin axis
is to make sure that microwave signals are
sent and received steadily. It isn&rsquo;t possible
to build an antenna that radiates at exactly
the same power in all directions. Telstar&rsquo;s
antennas work very well, but they operate
better in the direction of the satellite&rsquo;s
equator than they do towards its poles.
This means that if the spin axis is constantly
changing transmission will fade in
and out&mdash;even at times passing through
&ldquo;null&rdquo; where no transmission at all is possible.
No single fixed orientation is perfect
for the spin axis, but we decided that the
best average position would be to keep
it always perpendicular to the plane of
the earth&rsquo;s orbit. We tried to make sure
that the spin axis would not vary by more
than five degrees from this direction at
any time&mdash;although it probably could depart
as much as 15 or 20 degrees without
doing serious harm.</p>
<p>A second reason for being careful about
the satellite&rsquo;s spin axis is the problem of
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
heat balance. If one end of the satellite
points constantly at the sun and the other
end does not, the end near the sun will
get much too hot and the other will get
much too cold. Therefore, we tried to fix
the spin axis so that it stayed perpendicular
to a line drawn from the satellite to
the sun.</p>
<p>We also wanted to get a continuing report
on the effects of the magnetic field of
the earth at high altitudes. We knew these
would cause the spin axis to change with
time, or <i>precess</i>, but we couldn&rsquo;t be exactly
sure what these changes would be.</p>
<p>Since the orientation of Telstar&rsquo;s spin
axis was so important we installed a
<i>torque coil</i> in the satellite. This is a coil of
wire in which, upon a signal from the
ground, an electric current can be made
to flow. The current produces a magnetic
field that interacts with the earth&rsquo;s magnetic
field to change the position of the
satellite&rsquo;s spin axis. However, we could
not be sure that this device would work
properly&mdash;and this is another reason why
we wanted to keep track of the exact position
of the spin axis.</p>
<h3>Ways of Measuring the Spin Axis</h3>
<p>One of the devices built into Telstar is
a set of six <i>solar aspect cells</i> spaced at regular
intervals around the satellite. These
give a fairly accurate indication of the
angle between the spin axis of the satellite
and a line joining the satellite and the sun.
When sunlight strikes these solar cells,
they produce electric currents, and the
value of the current from each cell is sent
back to the ground via telemetry. Three
of the cells are in the satellite&rsquo;s northern
hemisphere; three are in the southern
hemisphere. If Telstar&rsquo;s north pole were
pointing to the sun, for example, the three
northern cells would record large, equal
currents; those in the southern hemisphere
would show zero current. But if
the spin axis were perpendicular to the
satellite-sun line (as we want it to be) all
six cells would report equal, average-sized
currents, which would fluctuate as the
satellite spun around. The solar cells were
carefully calibrated before Telstar was
launched, and we estimate that they can
tell us the angle between the satellite&rsquo;s
spin axis and the satellite-sun line to within
one or two degrees.</p>
<p>However, this one angle is not enough
to locate the spin axis exactly. As you can
see in <i><a href="#fig40">Diagram 1</a></i>, there are many possible
positions for the spin axis OP that have
the same angle &theta; with the satellite-sun
line OS. These positions all would lie on
the surface of an imaginary cone OPP&prime;
that has OS as its axis and 2&theta; as its vertex
angle. We need to have a second measurement
to find a single position for the spin
axis. As late as November 1961 we had
not found a satisfactory way to make such
a second measurement. Then Donald
Gibble of Bell Telephone Laboratories
suggested that we observe the reflections
of sunlight from mirrors fitted onto the
satellite<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Only when a satellite is in the right
position can you see the reflection of sunlight
from a plane surface on its body.
<i><a href="#fig41">Diagram 2</a></i> shows how flashes of reflected
light are observed. The light of the sun,
S, is reflected from a plane surface, R, on
the satellite to our observing station, T,
on the earth. If we imagine the line ORB
drawn perpendicular to R, we know, from
the law of reflection, that the angle of incidence,
<i>i</i>, made by the sunlight to this
line will be equal to the angle of reflection,
<i>i</i>&prime;, between the reflected light and
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
the same line. The law of reflection also
tells us that the sun, the line ORB, and the
observing station all must now lie in the
same plane. And, since we can calculate
where the satellite is in its orbit at this
exact moment, we can locate line ORB.
But what about the spin axis? We know
where on the satellite our reflector R is
located, so we know ahead of time what
the angle &theta;&prime; between ORB and the spin
axis, OP, will be. We call it the <i>flash angle</i>.
Thus we can tell that the spin axis will be
somewhere on the surface of an imaginary
cone OPP&Prime; that has ORB as its axis and
2&theta;&prime; as its vertex angle<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig40">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="449" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="smaller"><span class="ss">1.</span></span>
<br /><i>Solar aspect cells on the satellite report via
telemetry the amount of sunlight they receive;
from these data we can calculate the angle &theta;
between the satellite&rsquo;s spin axis, OP, and the
satellite-sun line, OS. This means that OP
can be anywhere on the surface of cone OPP&prime;.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig41">
<img src="images/p20a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="528" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="smaller"><span class="ss">2.</span></span>
<br /><i>When sunlight is reflected to observing station
T on the earth, we know that the angle
of incidence i must be equal to the angle of
reflection i&prime;, and, if ORB is a line perpendicular
to the reflector R, we know that the
sun, the observer, and line ORB must all lie
in one plane. Since we also know the position
of the satellite in its orbit and the distance
from it to the earth, we can locate line ORB
precisely. The reflector R is set at an angle
&theta;&prime; of 68&deg; from the spin axis OP. This tells us
that the spin axis must lie on the cone OPP&Prime;,
which is now precisely determined by its axis
ORB and its vertex angle 2&theta;&prime;, equal to 136&deg;.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<div class="img" id="fig42">
<img src="images/p21.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="552" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="smaller"><span class="ss">3.</span></span>
<br /><i>Cones OPP&prime; and OPP&Prime; intersect along the two lines OP and OQ, so these are the only possible
spin axis locations. From our general knowledge of the situation (or from any third measurement
of glint time), OQ can be ruled out, and we conclude that only OP can be the true spin axis.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In <i><a href="#fig42">Diagram 3</a></i> we have combined our
two measurements of the satellite&rsquo;s spin
axis. You can see that the two cones will
intersect along two straight lines, OP and
OQ; these are thus the only possible positions
that will satisfy both our measurements.
Actually, of course, only one of
these lines is the true location of the spin
axis. And it is usually obvious which one
it is, when we consider all our other data
about the satellite&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>Using this technique, if we measure the
exact times when we see flashes of reflected
sunlight from Telstar, we can combine
that information with data from our
six solar aspect cells and get a good plot
of the position of the satellite&rsquo;s spin axis.</p>
<p>In theory, this looked like a very promising
idea. But finding a satisfactory way
to put it into practice was something else
again. Our first thought was simply to
make use of the light reflected from the
sapphire covers on the satellite&rsquo;s solar
cells. However, these covers have a low
coefficient of reflection and do not form
a completely flat surface. This means that
the light reflected from them is very much
reduced in intensity and spreads out too
much to give us the precise readings we
want. On the other hand, if we attached a
plane mirror with a high reflection coefficient
to the satellite, we thought we could
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
pick up the minute flashes of reflected
light from a distance of as much as a few
thousand miles. So we decided to press
ahead with this scheme and install one or
more reflectors on the satellite.</p>
<p>By the time we started work on the mirrors,
the final design of Telstar I was almost
complete; this meant that we had to
squeeze our mirrors aboard it as best we
could. The most stringent physical requirement
in designing them was weight;
they could not add more than half a pound
to Telstar&rsquo;s total load. Nor could they project
more than one-eighth inch from the
satellite&rsquo;s surface, or they might interfere
with the radiation pattern for the main
antenna. We also decided to make the
mirrors out of highly polished metal, since
any other possible material might break
too easily. And the mirrors had to be as
flat as possible, so the beam of reflected
sunlight would not diverge by more than
one degree.</p>
<p>Thus we had to design mirrors that
would be very thin, very shiny, very flat,
very light, and almost unbreakable. After
much experimenting, we solved this rather
tricky problem. The mirrors we added
onto Telstar I, as you can see in <i><a href="#fig43">the illustration below</a></i>,
were machined
from aluminum alloy sheet, carefully polished
by hand with abrasive papers, and
buffed on a cloth wheel. Finally, we evaporated
a thin layer of pure aluminum onto
their surfaces to improve their reflection
coefficients and make them resistant to
corrosion. The three mirrors were fastened
to the surface of the satellite with small
screws, which had to be tightened and
shimmed very carefully so that the mirrors
stayed as flat as possible.</p>
<h3>Locating the Mirrors on the Satellite</h3>
<p>As we mentioned above, the flash angle &theta;&prime;
between the satellite&rsquo;s spin axis and a line
perpendicular to the mirror is very important
in our calculations. We made detailed
studies of the various flash angles that
would be possible during the first 60 days
after launch. We plotted the times when
the satellite would be above the horizon
while our Crawford&rsquo;s Hill, New Jersey,
observing station was in darkness, and we
made allowance for satellite orbits that
might deviate slightly from the planned
one. These calculations told us that the
best flash angle for the mirror would be
68 degrees&mdash;which is the angle made by
the first facets above Telstar&rsquo;s equatorial
antenna band. So we located a flat mirror
on one of these facets. Because one of the
solar aspect cells was already installed in
the center of this facet, we were forced
to cut a circular hole out of the center of
the mirror.</p>
<p>But we knew that one mirror could not
do the whole job. After Telstar I had been
in orbit more than 30 days, the 68-degree
mirror would only be in position to give
infrequent flashes, and one at about 95
degrees would be more useful. This presented
two problems. First, no facet on
the satellite makes a 95-degree angle with
the spin axis. However, we could use one
of the facets just below the equatorial antenna,
which makes a 112-degree angle,
and groove or <i>facet</i> the mirror so that its
reflecting faces became narrow strips
slanted 17 degrees away from the base at
the angle of 95 degrees (112 - 17 = 95).
Our second problem was space&mdash;since
there was not enough room left on any of
the 112-degree facets to mount a second
large mirror, we substituted two smaller
mirrors and mounted them 120 degrees
apart. This arrangement lets us know
from which mirror we see flashes&mdash;the
plane mirror gives one flash for each revolution
of the satellite; the faceted mirrors
give two flashes for each revolution
of the satellite.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h3>How We Record Flashes from the Mirrors</h3>
<p>Now we had finally found a satisfactory
way to reflect a train of tiny flashes&mdash;much
too faint to be seen by the naked
eye&mdash;from Telstar as it passed across the
sky during the night. But our main aim
was to record the exact times when these
flash bursts occurred. With this information,
we could, using the method we described
above, tell very accurately both
the satellite&rsquo;s spin axis and its rate of spin.
We do not have space to describe the
many problems that had to be solved in
setting up the equipment to record the
flashes. Let us merely outline the procedure
that we finally devised:</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="ss smaller">1.</span> <i>To pick up the satellite&rsquo;s flashes we
use a 12-inch-aperture photoelectric telescope
mounted on a radar trailer (shown
in <a href="#fig44">illustration below</a>). It is pointed by
means of prediction drive tapes produced
by an electronic computer; these are
based on data from previous passes.</i></p>
<p><span class="ss smaller">2.</span> <i>On clear, dark nights when the satellite
is at relatively short range, we can
see it with an auxiliary finder telescope,
and then adjust the large telescope precisely.
Or, if the satellite&rsquo;s high-frequency
beacon has been turned on, the Holmdel
microwave antenna can automatically
point our large telescope.</i></p>
<p><span class="ss smaller">3.</span> <i>When flashes of light are picked
up by the telescope, they fall directly onto
the cathode of a photomultiplier tube.
They are then filtered out from the random
light in the night sky and amplified.</i></p>
<div class="img" id="fig44">

<p class="pcap"><i>Twelve-inch telescope and electronics box mounted on a radar antenna pedestal at Crawford&rsquo;s
Hill. Three-inch sighting telescope mounted on top has since been replaced by six-inch telescope.</i></p>
</div>
<p><span class="ss smaller">4.</span> <i>Rather than make a continuous recording
of the output&mdash;one night this
would have produced a record twelve
miles long for us to pore over&mdash;we use
an electronic trigger. This is the time base

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Telstar I was launched on July 10, 1962.
That evening, beginning on the satellite&rsquo;s
seventh pass, we were able to detect trains
of flashes from the mirrors. We assumed
that, since Telstar had been launched almost
exactly according to plan, its spin
axis would be perpendicular to the plane
of the earth&rsquo;s orbit, and we calculated
when we should see the flashes. And, each
time, we actually saw them within two
minutes of the times we had predicted&mdash;so
we knew that the spin axis was almost
exactly where it should be.</p>
<p>Our measurements have continued
whenever the weather and other conditions
permitted. Combining readings from
the bursts of flashes and telemetry data
from the solar aspect cells, we have accurately
plotted Telstar&rsquo;s spin axis; it has
continued to precess very much as we predicted
it would. We have also seen what
happens to the spin axis when the satellite&rsquo;s
torque coil is turned on. And, by
measuring the intervals between flashes,
we have made very precise measurements
of the spin rate, which is gradually decreasing
mostly according to schedule.
However, the plot is showing some small
unexplained variations of spin decay rate,
and a study of them will, we hope, throw
light on some of the variations of the
earth&rsquo;s magnetic field.</p>
<p>For future communications work, particularly
with satellites at longer ranges,
it would seem to be preferable to use
stiffer, flatter mirrors and to make them
from beryllium rather than aluminum alloy.
More accurate tracking means, more
observatory sites, and more powerful telescopes
will also be needed. But for this
first experimental use our little mirrors
have worked very well.</p>

<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p><i>Before we learned about the Van Allen belts, we expected
that the solar cells used to power satellites would last for many years in
space. We thought they would be damaged only by cosmic rays, micrometeorites,
and occasional bursts of particles from the sun. But when the
solar plants of some American satellites went out of action after only a
few weeks in orbit, we realized that in the future solar cell power units
would need better protection from radiation damage. We had learned
that satellites&mdash;and particularly medium altitude communications satellites&mdash;must
spend a lot of time in regions where they will be struck by
thousands or even millions of high-speed radiation particles each second.</i></p>
<p><i>This fact forced us to change almost all our thinking about solar power
plants for satellites. To make sure they would last for several years, we
had to design new types of solar cells and devise new ways of mounting
them. We also had to revise our estimates of how much power we could
expect to get from our cells.</i></p>
<p><i>If a communications satellite is to go into regular commercial service, it
must continue working for several years in space. The Telstar satellite,
however, was designed as an experimental project, and we decided that
two years would be a reasonable lifetime to plan for. When Project Telstar
began, our problem was to develop solar cells that would operate in an
environment subject to strong radiation effects&mdash;and keep on operating
there for two years.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h3>Organizing the Work</h3>
<p>Our work on the solar cells for Telstar I
began in October, 1960. With just a little
more than a year to go before the satellite
had to be ready, there was no time to lose.
So we decided to break down the over-all
problem into three parts:</p>
<ul><li>Finding out how radiation would affect various kinds of solar cells;</li>
<li>Making experimental cells and, when the best had been picked, determining the best ways to make them in the large quantities we would need; and</li>
<li>Developing ways to mount the cells on the Telstar satellite so that they would withstand the stresses of being launched, the effects of radiation particles, and extreme changes in temperature.</li></ul>
<p>A different group of people began work
simultaneously on each of these three
parts of the problem, with each of them
going ahead under the assumption that the
others would be successful. Each group
had to find the answers to many very interesting
questions, but since our space is
limited we can only discuss some of them
here. Before doing so, however, we must
say something about what a solar cell is
and how it works.</p>
<h3>Technical Background on Solar Cells</h3>
<p>There are two ways of making a silicon
solar cell. In one, the body of the cell is
what we call <i>n-type</i> silicon&mdash;that is, pure
silicon that has been doped with a small
number of impurity atoms of an element
such as phosphorus or arsenic (from group
V of the periodic table). This kind of
semiconductor<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
conducts electricity by
means of a supply of free-to-move electrons
(negative charges) caused by the
presence of these impurity atoms. To
make a workable solar cell from n-type
silicon, a thin surface layer of p-type silicon
is formed by diffusing atoms of a material
from group III of the periodic table&mdash;usually
boron&mdash;into the silicon. Metallic
contacts then are made to these two
regions. This kind of cell is known as a
<i>p-on-n cell</i>.</p>
<p>The second type of solar cell is just the
reverse. It begins with a body of p-type
silicon (with impurity atoms from a group
III element) and conducts electricity by
means of &ldquo;holes&rdquo;&mdash;vacant sites where
electrons might be but are not. These
holes act as free-to-move positive charges.
We can make a solar cell from this material
by diffusing a layer of n-type impurity,
such as phosphorus, into it. We call
this an <i>n-on-p cell</i> (see the <i><a href="#fig47">figure below</a></i>).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig47">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="188" />
<p class="pcap">Construction of a silicon solar cell of the n-on-p type (thickness of n-layer greatly exaggerated).</p>

<dt>antireflection coating</dt>
<dt>contact gridding for lower series resistance</dt>
<dt>15 mil wafer, p-type</dt>
<dt>0.4 micron front layer, n-type</dt></dl>
<p>The key to the operation of either type
of solar cell is the junction between the
regions of n-type and p-type material&mdash;what
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
we call the <i>p-n junction</i>. In an actual
n-on-p cell this junction is only about
twenty millionths of an inch below the
surface, since that is the thickness of the
n-layer. At this point, where the hole-rich
p-region meets the electron-rich n-region,
there is a permanent, built-in electric
field. As shown in the <a href="#fig48">figure below</a>, the n-layer has many free electrons
(indicated by minus signs) and
a few holes (circled pluses), while the
p-region has many holes and a few electrons.
When the cell is in equilibrium,
thermal agitation causes some holes to
diffuse into the p-region. We call these
stray holes and electrons <i>minority carriers</i>
(the circled pluses and minuses in the
figure). Thus, the n-layer has a slight
positive charge and the p-body has a
slight negative charge; this results in a
difference in potential across the junction,
which in silicon amounts to about seven-tenths
of a volt.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig48">
<img src="images/p25.jpg" alt="" width="785" height="520" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Schematic diagram of an n-on-p solar cell. In
the n-layer, minuses represent free electrons,
circled pluses are minority-carrier holes; in
the p-type body, pluses represent holes,
circled minuses are minority-carrier electrons.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Sunlight is made up of individual corpuscles
of energy called <i>photons</i>. When
these photons are absorbed in or near a
cell&rsquo;s p-n junction, they liberate both a
free-to-move negative charge and a free-to-move
positive charge&mdash;this is called
generating a <i>hole-electron pair</i>. The electric
field across the p-n junction causes
the holes to flow to the p-side and the
electrons to the n-side of the barrier. This
flow tends to make the p-side positive and
the n-side negative, so that, when a load
is connected between them, a useful external
voltage (amounting to about six-tenths
of a volt) is produced, and electric
current will flow. Thus, we have converted
light energy into electrical energy.</p>
<p>Only part of the energy in light can be
used to generate an electrical output,
since a good deal of the light striking a cell
is absorbed as heat or is reflected from its
surface. The percentage of solar energy
that can be converted into usable electric
power is called the cell&rsquo;s <i>conversion factor</i>
or <i>efficiency</i>. Although this can theoretically
be as high as 22%, the best cells we
have made in the laboratory have conversion
factors of only about 15%, and
the better commercial cells have efficiencies
of 12% or more.</p>
<p>Although both p-on-n and n-on-p cells
were made in early laboratory studies, the
p-on-n cells gave a somewhat higher output.
As a result, all the American commercial
solar cells up to 1960 were of this
type, and they were used on all satellites
before Telstar I. (Russian satellites, we
believe, have used n-on-p cells from the
beginning.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The U.S. Army Signal Corps Research
and Development Laboratory, however,
decided to make both p-on-n and n-on-p
cells and compare their performance. This
laboratory work led to a surprising discovery:
The n-on-p cells were several
times as resistant to energetic particle radiation
as were comparable p-on-n cells.
These results were announced in 1960,
and confirmed by our measurements and
those of other laboratories. The timing
was very fortunate, since we had just
learned of the greatly increased radiation
hazards presented by the Van Allen belts.</p>
<h3>Finding Out About Radiation Damage</h3>
<p>Now, having given you a very brief account
of how a solar cell works, let us
return to our three-part problem. The first
objective was to study all the aspects of
radiation damage. To do this, we had to
find out how much radiation the Telstar
satellite would encounter; we needed to
estimate the concentration of high-energy
particles&mdash;both electrons and protons&mdash;at
various altitudes and locations. Several
government agencies are now carrying on
research in this important area, but at the
time of the Telstar I launch we did not
know exactly how much radiation the satellite
would run into. And the high-altitude
nuclear explosion of July 9, 1962
(the day before Telstar I went into orbit)
may have increased the quantity of high-energy
electrons injected into its path.</p>
<p>We also wanted to find out whether
electrons and protons would do the same
damage to solar cells. Several kinds of
cells were exposed at Bell Laboratories
and at various university research laboratories
to a wide range of radiation dosages.
The experiments showed, generally, that
the damage effects of electrons and protons
should be about the same. Although
protons are 1840 times as massive as electrons,
there are a great many more electrons
in the Van Allen belts, so that an
unprotected solar cell would be much
more likely to be injured by electrons
than by protons.</p>
<p>In fact, we found that the Van Allen
belt protons have so much energy that
they can go through transparent shielding
material as much as several centimeters
thick and still damage a solar cell. Thus,
to screen our cells from protons we would
need very thick transparent cover plates,
and this added weight would be intolerable.
So we decided to use no proton
shielding at all.</p>
<p>With electrons, the situation is different;
they are much lighter and have much
less energy. Also, if their energy is reduced
below a certain level (about 180
thousand electron volts) electrons will
not be able to knock silicon atoms out
of position, and thus cannot harm a solar
cell. We experimented with a number of
different kinds and thicknesses of cover
plates, and found that transparent material
with a mass of 0.3 gram per square
centimeter would slow down electrons
enough to make them no problem.</p>
<p>Another radiation study helped us take
advantage of the fact that solar cells respond
differently to light of different wave
lengths. If the surface layer of a cell is
extremely thin, it will absorb blue, green,
and yellow light well, but may be much
less sensitive to the deeply penetrating
red and infrared waves. We experimented
with n-on-p cells having very shallow p-n
junctions, exposing them to an extremely
strong radiation dosage. The cells still
responded very well to blue and green
light, even though most of their response
to infrared and red light was lost. These
findings convinced us that we should work
to make our new cells as blue-green sensitive
as possible, since they were going to
be exposed to heavy radiation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h3>Designing and Making the Best Solar Cells</h3>
<p>After it was discovered that the n-on-p
cell was more resistant to radiation, we
decided to make an all-out effort to develop
an n-on-p cell that could be manufactured
in quantity for our new satellite.
Since we didn&rsquo;t know whether we could
solve this problem in time to meet the
Telstar I launch date, we &ldquo;hedged&rdquo; by designing
the new n-on-p cells to be the
same physical size (one by two centimeters)
as conventional p-on-n cells. Thus,
if the n-on-p project hit a snag, we probably
could use regular p-on-n cells.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, making a solar cell
to fit the very high requirements we had
set for the Telstar satellite is not an easy
job&mdash;and making these cells by the thousands
is even more of a task. During October,
November, and December of 1960
we carried on a crash program in which
we made hundreds of experimental cells
in our laboratories, using a variety of materials
and many different manufacturing
techniques.</p>
<p>We perfected a phosphorus diffusion
process to develop the very thin n-layer
(about one forty-thousandth of an inch
thick) that we needed for our special
blue-sensitive n-on-p cells. We also had to
devise an entirely new way to attach the
metallic contacts to the highly polished
surfaces of our cells, using a combination
of titanium and silver.</p>
<p>Some tricky manufacturing problems
also had to be solved once the Western
Electric Company began to make the
large quantity of cells needed for the
Telstar program. For example, during the
diffusion of the n-layer of the cell, the
silicon slice is surrounded by phosphorus
pentoxide vapor, which covers the entire
slice with an &ldquo;n-skin.&rdquo; This skin must be
removed from the bottom of the cell by
etching or grit blasting before the p-contact
is applied. Another difficult problem
occurred when we decided to give our
cells an anti-reflection coating. Because
polished silicon has a refractive index
near 4 and space has an index of 1, silicon
will reflect about 34% of visible light from
the sun. However, if we apply an anti-reflection
layer onto the silicon this percentage
of reflection can be considerably
decreased. We found that the best substance
for this purpose was a layer of silicon
monoxide only three-millionths of an
inch thick. But it was only after quite a
bit of trouble&mdash;and scrapping several
thousand cells&mdash;that we were able to get
this coating to adhere properly in the
right thickness.</p>
<h3>Mounting the Cells on the Satellite</h3>
<p>The third part of our problem had to do
with finding the best ways to mount and
protect the cells on the Telstar satellite
itself. Since a satellite&rsquo;s solar power plant
usually has several thousand cells, we find
it best to mount the cells in groups, or
modules. These can be pretested as a unit
after individual interconnections have
been made. For Telstar I, we decided to
mount the 3600 solar cells in 12-cell modules
like those shown in the <i><a href="#fig49">figure below</a></i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<div class="img" id="fig49">
<img src="images/p26.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="800" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The satellite uses 300 modules of twelve solar cells, in groups of six or three modules per facet.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<div class="img" id="fig50">
<img src="images/p27.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="361" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Lengthwise diagram of a solar cell module, showing how individual cells were fixed in place.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Each of the cells has a top contact along
one edge and a bottom contact all over
its base, so we were able to assemble the
12-cell groups like shingles, with the bottom
edge of one cell covering the top
edge of the next, leaving only the active
area of each cell exposed. But this meant
that each module would be over four
inches long and only 14 thousandths of an
inch thick&mdash;far too weak to withstand
stress and vibration. To support the cells,
we decided to mount them on a metallized ceramic base. But this presented a
problem: If the cells were soldered directly
to the base, the different thermal expansion
rates of the silicon and the ceramic
would cause the structure to break
during the cycles of extreme changes in
temperature that Telstar would pass
through. We remedied this by connecting
each cell to the ceramic support by a thin
U-shaped strip of silver (<i><a href="#fig50">see above</a></i>). Since
silver has a much higher thermal expansion
coefficient than silicon, we added tiny
sandwiches of Nilvar or Invar (36% nickel,
64% iron) where the cells were attached.
With this mounting method, the
cell modules withstood thermal and mechanical
shocks much more severe than
those they would undergo in actual use.
In one test, for instance, an entire cell
module with its cover plates was first
dipped in hot water, then plunged into
liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -195&deg;
Centigrade. In orbit, the temperature
range for the satellite was not expected to
be more than from +80&deg; to -100&deg;C, with
a rate of change of no more than three
degrees a minute.</p>
<p>Finally, we needed to find the right
kind of transparent protective cover for
the Telstar solar cells, both to keep micrometeorites
from damaging the sensitive
and very thin diffused layer and to slow
down the incoming electrons to nondestructive
energy levels. For micrometeorite
protection, only a thin layer of hard
transparent substance was needed; for
electron protection, the cover plates
should have a mass of no less than 0.3
gram per square centimeter (as we explained
above). And there were two other
important considerations: The material
we used should not be darkened or discolored
by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet
radiation, and it should have good
thermal conductance, so that some of the
heat absorbed by the solar cells could be
conducted out to the cover plates and re-radiated.
All these requirements led us to
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
the choice of clear, man-made sapphire.
Although sapphire is more expensive and
difficult to make than the equivalent
quartz or glass, it only has to be 30 mils
(three hundreds of an inch) thick. Twice
this thickness would be required if quartz
or glass were used.</p>
<p>We have had space to describe only a
few of the things involved in designing a
solar cell power plant that would work unattended
out in space. We have not mentioned
a good many of the tough problems
that had to be worked on. But we are glad
to report that we could find answers to
almost all our questions. And the most
significant answer is shown in <i><a href="#fig51">the figure below</a></i>, where you can see how the Telstar
I solar power plant slowly diminished in
power almost exactly as we predicted it
would.</p>

<br />Would Time Delay Be a Problem in Using a Synchronous Satellite?</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Peter D. Bricker</span>
<br /><i>Psychologist&mdash;Member of Staff, Behavioral Research Laboratory</i></p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p><i>One of the satellite communications systems that has been
proposed would make use of stationary synchronous satellites. These would
be precisely located above the earth&rsquo;s equator in orbits 22,300 miles high,
where they would circle the earth once every 24 hours, and thus appear
to remain stationary over a point on the earth. There are several advantages
to this type of system&mdash;the most important being that we would
need only three satellites for communications between almost all the inhabited
regions of the earth.</i></p>
<p><i>On the other hand, there are several problems in establishing a synchronous
system. Just getting the satellites into exactly the right places
and keeping them in position is a formidable one. We also have something
of a mystery to contend with, because of the tremendous distances that
would be involved. Although we can communicate at speeds close to that
of light&mdash;186,000 miles per second&mdash;we cannot go any faster than that.
You might think that 186,000 miles a second was fast enough for us, and
most of the time it is. However, if you send signals 22,300 miles up into
the sky, transmit them back to earth, perhaps send them up again to a
second satellite, and finally bring them 22,300 miles back down to earth,
even the speed of light may not be fast enough. The delay will be only
about a second or so, but it may&mdash;for some kinds of communications&mdash;be
long enough to cause trouble. How much trouble, we don&rsquo;t yet know.</i></p>
<p><i>For one-way signals such as television, a transmission delay of about one
second obviously makes little or no difference. But for two-way conversations
on the telephone, where there is rapid back-and-forth talking, even
this tiny amount of time delay may be a problem. And then again, it may
not be. There have been a lot of experiments to find out something about
this delay problem, and these have given us a lot of different answers.
Work is still going on, and there is still much to find out. In this chapter,
we tell you about one small, early experiment. Its results were not conclusive,
but they should give you one example of how to set up and carry
out a typical experimental study on human behavior.</i></p>

<h3>How a Synchronous Satellite Would Work</h3>
<p>For our purposes, we will not be concerned
with all the problems of launching
a synchronous satellite into its proper
orbit. But you may be curious why we
know that this orbit must be 22,300 miles
high. It can be calculated by using two
basic formulas from elementary physics.</p>
<p>From Newton&rsquo;s Law of Gravitation we
know that the velocity, <i>v</i>, of a satellite
moving in a circular orbit<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> will be</p>
<div class="pc"><i>v</i> = <span class="x2">&#8730;</span><table class="eq inline"><tr><td class="ul"><i>gR</i>&sup2;</td></tr><tr><td class="ul"><i>r</i></td></tr></table>,</div>
<p>where <i>R</i> is the radius of the earth, <i>r</i> is the
distance from the center of the earth to
the satellite, and <i>g</i> is the acceleration due
to gravity (<i>see <a href="#fig52">diagram above</a></i>).</p>
<p>We also know that this velocity must be</p>
<div class="pc"><i>v</i> = <table class="eq inline"><tr><td>2&pi;<i>r</i></td></tr><tr><td class="ul"><i>T</i></td></tr></table>,</div>
<p>since the distance the satellite travels to
complete an orbit is 2&pi;<i>r</i>, and <i>T</i> is the
time of one complete revolution. Thus we
have the equality</p>
<div class="pc"><span class="x2">&#8730;</span><table class="eq inline"><tr><td class="ul"><i>gR</i>&sup2;</td></tr><tr><td class="ul"><i>r</i></td></tr></table> = <table class="eq inline"><tr><td>2&pi;<i>r</i></td></tr><tr><td class="ul"><i>T</i></td></tr></table>,</div>
<p>and, solving for <i>r</i>, we get</p>
<div class="pc"><i>r</i> = <table class="eq inline"><tr><td><i>gR</i>&sup2;<i>T</i>&sup2;</td></tr><tr><td class="ul">4&pi;&sup2;</td></tr></table><table class="eq inline"><tr><td><sup>&#8531;</sup></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table></div>
<p>Since we are interested in a synchronous
satellite, <i>T</i> in this case will be 24 hours.
We can now find <i>r</i> (using <i>g</i> = 32 feet per
second per second and <i>R</i> = 3960 miles),
and then obtain the distance <i>r</i> - <i>R</i>, which
will be 22,300 miles. By using our previous
formulas, we also can find the velocity
of a satellite moving in this orbit,
which will turn out to be <i>v</i> = 6870 miles
per hour.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>One possible method of using synchronous satellites. Signals from New York (N) to Paris (P)
would go via satellite S&#8321;; signals from New York to Calcutta (C) would go via satellites S&#8321; and S&#8322;.</i></p>
</div>
<p><i><a href="#fig53">The illustration above</a></i> gives a rough
idea of how a synchronous satellite system
might be set up. Three communications
satellites, <i>S</i>&#8321;, <i>S</i>&#8322;, and <i>S</i>&#8323;, are above the
equator in fixed positions equal distances
apart and 22,300 miles up. Located in this
manner, they would cover the major part
of the earth&rsquo;s surface. From a point directly
beneath it, the distance would be
22,300 miles to a satellite; from other
points the slant range would be greater.
Signals sent from, say, New York (point
N) to Paris (point P) would be reflected
via satellite <i>S</i>&#8321;. In doing this, they would
travel a total distance of about 46,000
miles. Because we can&rsquo;t send signals any
faster than the speed of light (186,000
miles per second), it would take at least
a quarter of a second for a signal to go
this far. For communicating a much
greater distance, say from New York to
Calcutta (point C), the signal path would
use two satellites, <i>S</i>&#8321; and <i>S</i>&#8322;. In this case,
the total distance traveled by a signal
would be more than 90,000 miles, and
the one-way time delay would be about
half a second.</p>
<h3>The Effects of Time Delay</h3>
<p>Delays of a quarter- or half-second have
different effects on various kinds of communications.
However, we are concerned
here only with what they might do to telephone
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
conversations. Time delay will affect
conversations in two ways. One of
these&mdash;pure delay&mdash;depends on the
nature of speech and the way people use
it to converse; the other&mdash;echo&mdash;has to
do with the nature of the world&rsquo;s telephone
systems.</p>
<p>The first effect can be illustrated by an
example. Suppose that George in Paris is
talking to me in New York. He says, &ldquo;Do
you want to go?&rdquo; and I answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; immediately
upon hearing the word &ldquo;go.&rdquo;
But that word didn&rsquo;t arrive in New York
until a quarter of a second after George
said it, and my reply was delayed another
quarter-second, so George hears my instantaneous
reply a half-second late.
Under some circumstances, he might
interpret this delay to mean that I was
less than enthusiastic about going. We
don&rsquo;t know exactly what response times
people expect in conversation, or how
much variation in such intervals they can
tolerate. But it has been assumed that
delays of a half-second or more would
make a noticeable and perhaps disturbing
difference. A little later on, I will describe
an experiment dealing with this first effect.
But first we must briefly discuss the
second effect of delay on telephone conversation,
to show why we decided to try
to isolate the first effect and study it
separately.</p>
<h3>The Echo Problem</h3>
<p>All the world&rsquo;s telephones are individually
connected to the rest of the system
by what we call <i>two-wire local loops</i>.
Speech travels in both directions on the
same wires over these local parts of the
circuit. In other parts of the system, where
speech travels farther and must be amplified,
it is carried over four-wire circuits.
These consist of two pairs of wires, one
for transmission in each direction. At the
junctions where the two-wire and four-wire
parts of the telephone system meet,
specially designed transformers, called
<i>hybrid coils</i>, are used.</p>
<p>It is impossible to have these junctions
between two-wire and four-wire circuits
always in perfect balance, so part of the
speech that reaches a local loop will be
reflected back along the path on which
it arrived. Unless a circuit has been specially
treated, this reflected speech will
get all the way back to where it started,
and the talker will hear an echo of his own
voice. When the circuit is short enough,
the echo is heard almost instantaneously,
and is not bothersome. But when the
echo is delayed by a twentieth of a second
or more, it can become extremely annoying,
and even temporarily destroy one&rsquo;s
ability to speak coherently.</p>
<p>Telephone engineers have long been
aware that this echo effect was present
on their long-distance circuits, and they
have not let it go unchecked. Devices
known as <i>echo suppressors</i> are installed
on circuits that have more than a critical
amount of delay. They are placed in a
four-wire part of the circuit, where there
is one-way transmission over each pair.
Since incoming and outgoing sounds are
using separate paths, an echo suppressor
can attenuate or shut off the return path
when speech is coming in on the other
path.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, echo suppressors have
effects of their own on transmission. They
may, for example, cut off some speech that
should be getting through, because they
can&rsquo;t distinguish it from echo. Echo suppressors
can be made more sophisticated,
but whether they can be made to operate
more successfully than present ones is not
clear. And the problem of adapting them
to the long delays of synchronous satellite
circuits will require a great deal of
research and development effort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h3>Experimenting With Pure Delay</h3>
<p>Although we don&rsquo;t know how good echo
suppressors can get, we do know that a
long circuit with the best possible suppressors
could never be <i>better</i> than a circuit
of the same length that had no echos.
This brings us back to the problem of how
serious the effect of delay alone is on conversations.
If the delay in a synchronous
satellite system, even without any echo,
made conversation all but impossible,
there would be little point in developing
echo suppressors for such satellites.</p>
<p>This question looked like one that we
could answer, at least in part, by experimenting
with special four-wire circuits
that had delay but no echo. The strategy
we adopted, then, was to do some experiments
on pure delay while other people at
Bell Telephone Laboratories began to attack
the problem of testing and improving
echo suppressors. In the pages that
follow, I will describe one of our experiments
on the pure delay problem. More
elaborate ones have been performed since,
and there will be more to come.</p>
<p>It should now be clear how this sort of
experiment might be helpful to the development
of a synchronous satellite communications
system. If it showed pretty
convincingly that conversation was extremely
difficult with a pure echo-free
delay of about a second, synchronous satellites
for two-way conversations would
be less practical. On the other hand, if
the experiment were to show that some
conversation, at least, could be carried on
without too much difficulty, our results
would be less decisive. We would know
only that <i>echo-free</i> delayed circuits might
<i>sometimes</i> be all right. But we would not
know how bad they were under a variety
of conditions or how closely they resembled
a real circuit with echoes and echo
suppressors. In either case, the experiment
would have no bearing on the use of
synchronous satellites for one-way purposes,
such as television.</p>
<h3>Designing the Experiment</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig54">

<p class="pcap"><i>Recording equipment used in the experiment.</i></p>

<div class="center ssn">

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can people converse over an echo-free,
four-wire circuit that has delay like that
of a synchronous satellite?&rdquo;&mdash;that is one
way of putting the question we isolated
to study. The next problem was to find
a way of setting up this question in the
form of an experiment whose results
might be interpreted as a meaningful answer.
The problem of apparatus, fortunately,
was fairly simple. Two telephone
sets in separate rooms were connected by
four wires, with one pair going directly
from each transmitter to the other receiver,
so that no echo would go back the
way it came. This gave us the &ldquo;echo-free,
four-wire circuit&rdquo; we wanted. To simulate
the satellite, I inserted a magnetic delay
device (<i>see <a href="#fig54">sketch</a></i>) between one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
transmitters and the other receiver. This
had a revolving drum on which speech
could be recorded and then played back
a short interval later. By moving the playback
head, I could produce any amount
of delay up to two satellite bounces&rsquo; worth.
At this point, the equipment was ready,
but there were still two major problems:
(1) how to get people to converse over
the circuit in a natural way, and (2) what
to observe and measure that would give
us an answer to our question.</p>
<p>When you think about the first problem,
you soon realize that it is hard to
say exactly what a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; conversation
is. But even if we can&rsquo;t describe it, we
can try to find examples of it. I experimented
with several ways of making people
talk that could be recognized as <i>un</i>natural:
word games, list-checking, shape
description and recognition, and a system
of rewards for spurts of talk. None of
these schemes seemed to generate the real
conversational interplay we wanted. Finally,
I noticed that my coworkers often got
involved in vigorous conversations on political
and social issues at the lunch table.
So I circulated a questionnaire to help
me pick pairs of people who might enter
into lively discussions on one or more topics.
I arranged seven conversations of this
sort, and they became the basic material
of my study. Only one of these lacked
sufficient spirit to yield good data, and six
out of seven is a pretty good percentage
when you try to study human behavior
in such a free situation. Note that the conversers
expressed ideas that came from
<i>within</i> them at the time&mdash;not from any
external materials&mdash;and that they usually
felt rather strongly about what they were
saying to the other fellow, who disagreed
and therefore needed some convincing.
Of course, these conversations do not represent
the whole range of possible conversations;
they are only a small sample of
one type. This doesn&rsquo;t limit the truth of
the particular result we got, but it does
limit how far we may generalize from
these results.</p>
<h3>What Should We Observe?</h3>
<p>You might think we could solve this problem
simply by asking the conversers their
opinions. We found out long ago, however,
that the opinions you get are affected
by a lot of things: how you ask the
question, the attitude of the respondent,
and his unrelated experiences outside the
experiment. So we usually try a more
subtle approach. In this case, my basic
observation was of what psychologists
call <i>escape behavior</i>. The conversers were
told that they would start talking over a
normal circuit, and that delay would be
introduced at some point. (The delay was
inserted in such a way that an abrupt
change could not be noticed.) All the conversers
had pushbuttons for signaling the
experimenter. If they thought they noticed
a delay, they were told that it would
be removed if they pushed the button.
Thus they could always escape from this
possibly unpleasant condition.</p>
<p>My reasoning was this: If the conversers
found it very difficult to talk with
delay in the circuit, they would surely
push the button soon after the delay was
introduced. On the other hand, any time
when they continued to converse without
pushing the button&mdash;while delay was in
the circuit&mdash;was obviously also a time
when the delay did <i>not</i> make conversation
impossible. So we had at least one measurable
quantity&mdash;the time taken to detect
delay&mdash;which we could interpret as an
answer to our question. Note that we
could tell if people pushed the button
&ldquo;just to be on the safe side&rdquo; by seeing how
often they did this when there actually
was no delay in the circuit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>There are just a few more necessary details
before we discuss the results:</p>
<ul><li>I recorded the conversations for later
analysis, but the conversers knew that the
recordings would be held in confidence.</li>
<li>The amount of delay used was 1.2
seconds, which represents the total round-trip
delay for a circuit using two satellites,
including the delay in typical end connections
on the ground. We used this
much delay because our preliminary tests
indicated that it would be more likely to
produce an effect than would the 0.6
second delay in a one-satellite link.</li>
<li>The entire 1.2 seconds of delay was put
into one of the lines, since we had discovered
that, where there is no echo, conversers
cannot tell the difference between
a delay of 2<i>t</i> seconds in one line and a
delay of <i>t</i> seconds in each of two lines. I
did this for the sake of convenience, so
that I could introduce delay in the quiet
line while the other one was active.</li>
<li>After someone detected delay, I removed
it immediately and then waited at
least a minute before putting it back in.</li>
<li>Altogether, I collected about two hours
of conversation and introduced delay 22
times.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Results and What They Mean</h3>
<p>Now we could answer the question, &ldquo;How
long <i>does</i> it take people to detect 1.2 seconds
of delay?&rdquo; As you can see from <i><a href="#tablex">the table opposite</a></i>, the times ranged all the
way from 20 seconds to over 10 minutes,
and, in two cases delay was not detected
at all. The results in the table are also
shown in <i>the <a href="#fig55">histogram on the next page</a></i>,
which depicts how broadly the detection
times were distributed. To me, one of
the most interesting things is that even
people who were able to detect delay
quickly sometimes did <i>not</i> detect it for a
couple of minutes. For example, the pair
K/G had two times under a minute, one
of 143 seconds, and one of 421 seconds.
I interpret their two short times to mean
that they knew what to look for, since they
made no incorrect responses while delay
was not present. However, their long
times seem to mean that they sometimes
didn&rsquo;t notice delay for quite a while. Incidentally,
only two responses were made
during the total of about 40 minutes when
I did not introduce delay, and these &ldquo;false
alarms&rdquo; were by two of the fastest pairs
at true detection&mdash;F/K and S/H.</p>

</div>
<p>Now, to answer our question about
whether people can converse over our
circuit, we can say something like this:
We have found some cases (of a certain
type of conversation) where people <i>can</i>
use a circuit with 1.2 seconds of echo-free
delay for the amounts of time listed
in our table. But there are two important
things to remember about our results:</p>
<ul><li><i>The findings are a</i> non-negative <i>answer
to the original question, &ldquo;Can people converse
over a four-wire, echo-free circuit
that has delay like that of a synchronous
satellite?&rdquo;</i></li>
<li><i>The experiment applies</i> only <i>to four-wire,
echo-free circuits, and does not help
with the problem of improving echo suppressors
or with that of finding out how
good synchronous satellite circuits with
the best possible echo suppressors would
be if they were used to interconnect the
world&rsquo;s telephones.</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="tb">Since we didn&rsquo;t get a &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to
our question, we have been encouraged to
do more experiments with other subjects
and other types of conversations. We also
have begun to look for more than a yes-or-no
answer; we now want to find out
how serious various amounts of pure delay
would be. Some of my colleagues have
been working on this problem by furnishing
special four-wire telephones to a
group of people, so that echo-free delay
can be inserted in the line when one member
of this test group calls another member.
Their experiment has confirmed our
finding that conversation with a round-trip
pure delay of 1.2 seconds is not impossible,
but it has also shown that the
degradation of conversation that results
is not trivial.</p>
<p>Recently an international committee on
commercial telephone standards set the
maximum permissible echo-free delay
(round-trip) at 0.7 seconds. However, the
search for a more precise evaluation is
still going on.</p>

<br />How Can We Repair an Orbiting Satellite?</h2>

<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p><i>It is hard enough to fix a new piece of scientific equipment
when it goes out of order in the laboratory. And when the equipment is
sailing around the earth a couple of thousand miles up in the sky a repair
job ought to be impossible. But during the last two months of 1962 we
found this not to be true at all. That was when the Telstar I satellite began
to misbehave and eventually would not obey the commands we sent it from
the ground. This presented us with a nice little problem: We had to find
out exactly what was wrong with the satellite and then&mdash;the really tough
job&mdash;devise a way to cure the trouble. We were able, finally, to do both
these things, after a combination of logical deduction, trial-and-error
experimentation, and laboratory testing&mdash;plus a certain amount of plain
good luck. Our &ldquo;cure,&rdquo; unfortunately, turned out to be only a temporary
one, for our patient had a relapse some weeks later. However, the story
of how we went about doing our never-before-attempted task should give
you an idea of the things you have to improvise in the laboratory when an
experiment doesn&rsquo;t work out exactly as you had planned.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h3>The Telstar Command Circuit</h3>
<p>As shown on pages <a href="#Page_32">32</a> and <a href="#Page_33">33</a>, the operation
of the Telstar I satellite was controlled
by orders sent from the ground on a frequency
of 123 megacycles. Fifteen different
commands could be given to the
satellite, each a coded signal made up of
a series of ones and zeros. The signals,
as you can see in the <i><a href="#tablec">table below</a></i>,
turn on or off the radiation experiments,
the telemetry, the communications equipment,
and the orientation coil. These are
important functions, and we wanted them
to be going on when they were needed.
But we did not want them to be operating
continuously.</p>
<p>Command was the only Telstar I function
that we felt had to be &ldquo;redundant,&rdquo;
so two duplicate chains of components
were provided. As you can see in <i><a href="#fig56">the block diagram on the next page</a></i>, the satellite has
two radio receivers in parallel, so that one
can operate if the other fails. There are
also two command decoders, which take
the pulse-coded signals from the receivers
and translate their zeros and ones into usable
instructions. In the command switching
control, these instructions operate nine
relays that turn on or off the power to all
the electronic circuits except the command
receiving chain, which operates
continuously.</p>
<p>Telstar I&rsquo;s telemetry unit reported back
112 measurements every minute over the
136-megacycle frequency. These told
both what the satellite encountered in
space and the condition of the satellite&rsquo;s
own components&mdash;as indicated by a variety
of different sensors. The telemetry
also gave a check on whether the commands
sent to the satellite were actually
obeyed.</p>

<h3>What Went Wrong With Telstar I</h3>
<p>During Telstar I&rsquo;s first two months in orbit,
the only indication of trouble cropped
up in one of the command operations.
Telemetry told us that the satellite was
no longer executing the T2 command.
This meant that we could not temporarily
disconnect command chain No. 1 to check
the performance of chain No. 2. Then, a
short while later, No. 2 began to give intermittent
operation. Finally it failed completely.
At the time, we didn&rsquo;t know why
this had happened, but, since the satellite&rsquo;s
other command chain still seemed to
be operating normally, we were not very
worried.</p>
<p>However, in the middle of November
1962 command chain No. 1 also began to
be intermittent. We would send a command
but get no response from the satellite;
only after we repeated it a few times
would the satellite finally do what it had
been told to do. Now there was something
to be concerned about. And, if chain No.
1 should fail, we had to make sure that
Telstar would be left in a favorable operating
condition. We didn&rsquo;t want the satellite&rsquo;s
communications equipment to be
left on without our being able to turn it
off&mdash;this would keep a continuous drain
on the power supply.</p>
<p>As we feared it would, the other command
circuit went out of commission on
November 23rd. However, when this happened,
the communications circuits had
been turned off, although the command
chains themselves and the telemetry remained
on. This meant that we could still
try to send commands, the condition of
the satellite could still be monitored by
telemetry, and the solar cells could still
supply useful power. But, since we could
not turn the communications equipment
on, Telstar I could no longer be used for
transatlantic television or any of the experiments
we had been carrying on successfully
since July.</p>
<h3>Looking for the Trouble Spot</h3>
<p>At this point a number of Bell Telephone
Laboratories engineers began to analyze
Telstar&rsquo;s troubles. As you can imagine, we
had a rather difficult problem. We obviously
could neither go up and look at
Telstar nor bring it down for an overhaul
on the ground. We could only send different
commands to the satellite and
watch the telemetry data to see what, if
anything, happened.</p>
<p>After checking the satellite&rsquo;s other
equipment, we were happy to find that
everything except the command chains
was in good condition. So we decided the
trouble had to be one of five possibilities:</p>
<ul><li><i>excessive electronic &ldquo;noise&rdquo; in the satellite, which had blocked the command receivers;</i></li>
<li><i>extreme temperature variations, which had caused a joint to expand, contract, and finally break;</i></li>
<li><i>a loose connection;</i></li>
<li><i>slow aging of an electronic component;</i></li>
<li><i>deterioration of a component from excessive radiation bombardment.</i></li></ul>
<p>We could quickly narrow this list down.
Telemetry indicated that the receiver was
not being blocked by noise. Reports from
the temperature-measuring thermistors
told us that inside the satellite the temperature
was 75 degrees Fahrenheit, just as
it should be. A loose connection was very
unlikely, because every one had been
made by expert wiremen, examined by
trained inspectors, and then completely
encapsulated in polyurethane foam. Aging
also seemed very improbable, since
all the components had been individually
tested and selected for the highest reliability
and longest life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h3>The Villain: Radiation</h3>
<p>This left only radiation damage. We had
other good reasons to suspect this, too. As
far back as October 1961, scientists at Bell
Labs and Brookhaven National Laboratories
had made an important discovery
about the effect of radiation on a transistor.
They found that, when radiation penetrates
the outer shell of a transistor and
ionizes the gases inside, electrically
charged particles (ions) tend to collect
on the surface and change the transistor&rsquo;s
electric properties. This effect is particularly
noticeable when a transistor is operating
under reverse bias voltage. We knew
that some of the 37 transistors used in
each Telstar I decoder circuit were operating
under continuous reverse bias and
that they also had less metal shielding
than did those semiconductors in the
telemetry and receiver circuits.</p>
<p>Telstar&rsquo;s radiation detectors had been
telling us that the concentration of high-energy
electrons near the inner edge of
the Van Allen belt was greater than we
had expected. We now know this may
have come as a result of man-made high-altitude
nuclear explosions, one of which
took place the day before Telstar I was
launched. But we had had no reason to
anticipate this extra radiation&mdash;it was
more than one hundred times the predicted
level&mdash;when we tested the transistors
to be used in Telstar I. So we were not
too surprised that they were more susceptible
to radiation damage than we had
thought they would be.</p>
<p>All this seemed to give us a theoretical
explanation for the trouble. So, after November
23rd, we began looking for laboratory
evidence to confirm our radiation
theory. First, two engineers traveled down
to Johannesburg, South Africa. At this
time the highest point of Telstar&rsquo;s orbit&mdash;when
it passes through the least Van Allen
belt radiation&mdash;was over the southern
hemisphere, and it seemed a good idea to
command the satellite when it was under
the condition of lowest radiation and see
if anything would happen. However,
everything the engineers tried proved
fruitless.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig57">
<img src="images/p33.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="801" />
<p class="pcap"><i>A duplicate of one of Telstar I&rsquo;s command
decoders, containing 37 transistors and 191
diodes, being placed in a small elevator that
will lower it into a gamma radiation chamber.</i></p>
</div>
<p>At our Murray Hill, New Jersey, laboratories
we worked on a different approach.
We exposed transistors like those
used in the decoders to large doses of
radiation. We also exposed entire spare
decoder units to accelerated radiation to
find out where their weakest points were
(<i>see <a href="#fig57">illustration</a></i>). And then we built and
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
tested decoders using radiation-resistant
transistors to see if they worked better.
After a week of intensive laboratory work,
we had some pretty good evidence. The
tests of individual transistors definitely
showed that heavy radiation would cause
them to deteriorate. Testing of the complete
decoders also led to some failures,
and, when we analyzed them, they turned
out to be the kind that would be caused
by faulty transistors. We also discovered
that the most sensitive part of a decoder
circuit was the zero gate, which recognizes
the zeros in the one-and-zero code
that commands the satellite.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig58">
<img src="images/p33a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="278" />
<p class="pcap"><i>A typical command signal sent to Telstar I. It consists of seven pulses: a three-unit &ldquo;start&rdquo; pulse
and a binary code made up of three two-unit &ldquo;one&rdquo; pulses and three one-unit &ldquo;zero&rdquo; pulses.</i></p>
</div>
<h3>Fooling the Decoder</h3>
<p>Now we thought we knew the guilty component,
but the hardest job still lay ahead
of us. We had to do something to the
commands so that they would bypass this
troublesome zero gate. Each of the fifteen
satellite commands is a binary code of
seven pulses, as illustrated in <i><a href="#fig58">the diagram above</a></i>.
The first&mdash;the <i>start pulse</i>&mdash;is three
units wide. Then follow six more pulses of
which three are two units wide (<i>one
pulses</i>) and three are one unit wide (<i>zero
pulses</i>). The arrangement of this group of
six ones and zeros determines the particular
command.</p>
<p>Each time a one pulse arrives at the
decoder, a <i>one gate</i> counts the pulse and
stores a one in its memory. A <i>zero gate</i>
counts the zero pulses, but does not store
anything. So, if the zero gate is blocked,
the decoder will not count the zeros in
any of the coded commands and thus
cannot decode them properly.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig59">
<img src="images/p33b.jpg" alt="" width="369" height="110" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The special &ldquo;notched one&rdquo; pulse that was invented
to fool Telstar I command decoder.</i></p>
</div>
<p>What could be done about this? The
answer seemed to be to devise a new type
of pulse&mdash;a pulse that would be enough
like a one so that it would pass through
the one gate and advance the counter,
but, at the same time, be enough unlike
a one so that the one gate would not store
it in its memory. This led to the invention
of the special long pulse with a dip or
notch in it that is shown in <i><a href="#fig59">the diagram above</a></i>. When we tested it in the laboratory
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
on one of the duplicate decoders we had
exposed to radiation, this new notched
pulse worked as we hoped it would. It
passed through the one gate and advanced
the counter, but was not stored as a one in
the one gate&rsquo;s memory. Thus it fooled the
decoder by doing just what a zero is supposed
to do, even though it had gone
through the one gate rather than the zero
gate.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig60">
<img src="images/p34.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="679" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Magnetic tapes of special codes using notched ones in place of zeros being prepared for use.</i></p>
</div>
<p>But the real test was yet to come. Special
modified signals for two of the fifteen
Telstar commands, using our new notched
ones in place of the usual zeros, were put
on magnetic tape (<i>see <a href="#fig60">photograph</a></i>). Then,
on December 20th, when Telstar made
its 1492nd pass over Andover, Maine, a
group of tired engineers huddled about
the mass of equipment they had assembled.
Finally, on the third try, the notched
pulses were successful; Telstar&rsquo;s telemetry
flashed back the word that the proper relay
had operated upon command.</p>
<h3>Removing the Ionization</h3>
<p>We now wanted to get Telstar to do something
that had seemed to work in the laboratory.
The transistors most affected by
radiation were those operating under continuous
reverse bias, to whose surfaces
unwanted ions were attracted. If we removed
the voltage from these transistors,
we felt that the ionization layer would be
dissipated, and they would act normally
again. Our plan was to prepare a complete
taped program of all fifteen commands,
and carefully disconnect Telstar&rsquo;s storage
battery (using command SS). Then, when
the satellite went into eclipse, there would
be no power available from the solar cells
either, and&mdash;if our calculation was right&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
complete lack of voltage ought to
restore the transistors to working order.
This was a hazardous procedure, for if
something went wrong we might have a
completely silent satellite on our hands.</p>
<p>As it turned out, an accident did happen&mdash;but
one of a different and much
more fortunate kind. On December 27th
Telstar misinterpreted our &ldquo;trick&rdquo; commands
and disconnected its own battery
before we asked it to. Then, as the satellite
went into the earth&rsquo;s shadow, we held
our breath while all its power stopped
and the telemetry went silent. But, as we
had hoped, a rest period with all power
removed from the deteriorated transistors
apparently made them work almost normally
once again. On January 1, 1963, we
were able to disconnect the battery in
regular fashion&mdash;that is, using the one-and-zero
code. After this was done, and
all power had been removed, both decoders
again would operate when given
normal commands (actually, the first one
restored to duty was decoder No. 2,
which had gone out of order first, back in
August).</p>
<h3>Back to Normal&mdash;For a Time</h3>
<p>For more than a month Telstar I behaved
as it should, and our communications experiments,
including television broadcasts,
were resumed on January 3rd. During
this time we used both normal commands
and our special notched-pulse
modified commands. Whenever normal
commands became intermittent we used
the modified commands to disconnect the
battery for several eclipses.</p>
<p>Our good fortune, however, did not last.
Continued exposure to radiation apparently
led to further damage to Telstar I&rsquo;s
transistors. By February 14th, disconnecting
the storage battery no longer returned
the decoder to normal, and we could operate
only with our modified commands.
And, on the 21st, the satellite apparently
misinterpreted a command, disconnected
its storage battery, and went silent. Since
then, none of our modified commands
has been able to bring back its voice.
There is still a possibility that Telstar I
may recover if it remains out of the high-radiation
part of space for a long enough
period&mdash;but as time goes by this appears
less likely.</p>
<p>However, our work was not in vain. Because
we pinpointed the effects of radiation
on the transistors in Telstar I, this
problem was counteracted on the Telstar
II satellite launched on May 7, 1963 (see
<a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>). To avoid the worst of the radiation
effects, the second Telstar is in a considerably
larger orbit, which causes it to
spend less time in the heaviest high-energy
Van Allen belt regions. It carries new radiation
detectors with much greater measuring
capacity. And in one of Telstar II&rsquo;s
command decoders we are using a new
type of transistor, which we hope will not
be affected nearly as much by radiation
as were the ones in Telstar I&rsquo;s ill-fated
decoders.</p>

<h3>A Final Note to the Reader</h3>
<p><i>Now, having read Part II of</i> Satellite Communications Physics, <i>you should
have an idea how we predict the orbit of an artificial satellite and how we
find out where it points while passing a thousand miles above our heads.
You can see how we pick the best material to cover its surface with and
how we protect its solar cells from the hazards of space. And you have
watched the steps we would take when our satellite stops working properly.</i></p>
<p><i>It would, we admit, take a little more experience to solve problems like
these on your own&mdash;and to deal with all the other complications of
satellite communications. But we hope our brief glimpses into the laboratory
have shown what this experience might be like. Our six case histories
have only scratched the surface, but they should give you a good idea of
the fascinating work that goes into practical science and engineering.
They should show that something like Project Telstar doesn&rsquo;t succeed
only because of far-sighted, imaginative thinking&mdash;nor only because of
ingenious engineering. It draws upon the best of both of these.</i></p>
<p><i>Along the way, we hope you have noticed some important guideposts&mdash;things
like Newton&rsquo;s law of gravitation, the law of reflection of light,
the Stefan-Boltzmann law. They typify the basic principles of physics that
engineers and scientists, whatever they do, must always keep in mind.
No matter how exotic or up-to-the-minute the application, the ground
rules of physics must be followed. If we have convinced you of this, we
have done what we set out to do!</i></p>
